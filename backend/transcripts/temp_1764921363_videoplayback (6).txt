 Yes, good morning. May I please be connected to... Hi, so my name is... I am with... And we specialize in traditional insurance broker services, and we use Enterprise Risk Management to help reduce your annual spend and increase the value of your company. Would you be interested in reducing your annual spend when it comes to your current insurance program, or have you considered it? We are in a captive program, so we're not looking to get out of that anytime soon. Okay, and that's nice and awesome to hear, and our approach often works with what you are already doing, and we can actually explore ways to help you save on your spend by up to 25%. So the way it works is that we will take a look at your current insurance program and find ways to help reduce risks and grow stronger without extra effort on your part. We're the top 18 largest policy-held agency, and we're recognized as the leader in the industry for size and impact. Have you ever evaluated how your insurance programs align with your long-term goals as a company? We have. I don't think there's an interest right now to look out anywhere else. Okay, well, the purpose of the call was just to see if you would be open just to a quick call with our risk management specialist to see if this would work for you. Are you open to this? We're not trying to get you to buy anything or change anything. We would just like to let you see what your options would be. I mean, it's just, I don't know the call being pretty busy, so that's kind of my... It would probably take about 15 to 30, depending on any questions that you have and things that you ask to go over. Okay. Okay. Are you available tomorrow the 17th or Friday the 18th? No, I'm off the rest of the week. I won't be back next week. How about Tuesdays at 22nd? Tuesday? Yes, the 22nd. That's fine. Okay, and you are... correct? Yes. Let's see here. What we have... Do you want mid-afternoon or late afternoon or mid-evening? We can go all the way up to 7.15 p.m.? I'm just wondering if my time is better. Right. We can do a 12.45 or 1.15, 1.45, or we can go all the way up until 7.15. What works for you? 1.15. 1.15, okay. And I have your email as... Yes. Okay. And I have you set then for the 30-minute call. And then is there anyone else that will be joining the call with you? I think it would just be me. And what is your title? HR Director. Okay. And this is the best number to reach you at this? Yes. All right then. All right then. I have you all set then, like I said, for the phone call with... and it is on Tuesday the 22nd at 1.15 Pacific Standard Time. Yes. All right then. You have a great day. All right. You too. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye.
