 Hello, this is Amy. Hi, this is Amy. I'm with the company. We do a conference annually and provide timekeeping automation software for the wireless construction industry. Did you guys get a chance to talk about your conference in New York City? Yes, we did. Fantastic. Any chance you were able to stop by our booth? I don't think we did. We were only in there quickly. We were in and out. I don't believe so. Okay. So what we do is we reduce non-productive time your employees spend away from the job site. We don't need to replace any of your current systems as our focus would be on time capture only. So it automates all of your field crews. All they have to do is clock in and out. We take care of the rest. We do also help to increase the time your remote employees spend at the job site by 10 to 15%. I was calling to see if you would have any availability for a quick call with our co-founder. I'll show you a little bit about what it does and see if it might be a good fit. I'm actually on the road for the next two days. Maybe some we can set up later in the week or next week. Oh, absolutely. I'd be happy to set something up. Let's see. I do have availability next Monday or we can certainly look at April. Next Monday should be fine. Alrighty. Let's see here. I have times I've got from 12 p.m. to 4 30. So it looks like afternoon. Yeah. Anytime before 2, anytime before 2 o'clock is fine. Alrighty. Can I get your pencil then for 12 30? Yeah. Do you have my email address? I do have. Correct. Alright. Fantastic. Any way you can change the phone number for some reason. This is my personal cell phone and not my work cell phone. Oh, absolutely. What's the better number for you? 781. 789. Alrighty. And typically how many, you know, crews or people do you have in the fields on a day to day? There's like seven crews, maybe about 35 40 guys. Okay. Fantastic. So what I will go ahead and do then is get you an email sent out. Well, the booking details for that quick meeting with we've set for Monday, March 31st at 12 30. And that is an Eastern standard time. And I will go ahead and update the phone number as well. Okay. Thank you so much. Yes, sir. Thank you. Bye bye. Hmm.
