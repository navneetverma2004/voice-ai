My name is Zina. I'm with the firm. I was just trying to reach the person in charge of business development for the firm. Do you know if they're available? Let me see if I can transfer you now, okay? Alrighty, thank you. You're welcome. Hi, good morning. My name is Zina. I'm with the firm. I was just trying to reach the person in charge of business development. Would it be you or someone else? That would actually be me. Well, nice to meet you, ma'am. We specialize in helping long firms increase their online presence, which makes it easier for potential clients to find you and decrease your annual spend to find them. We do create educational content for your website if you have one. For example, if you have a couple considering divorce, they will have certain questions and we can create custom content to have those questions answered for them. The purpose of my call is just to see if you would be open to giving visual perspective and see if this would work for you. I think I might have in the past. What's the name of your company? Yes, ma'am. You know what? I don't know right now that we need those services. We can definitely help with that. Yeah, so if you have any information. Okay, I can definitely do that. What would be a good email for you? Let me know when you're ready. I'll spell it out for you. I'm ready. Got it. Just make calls. That's correct. Perfect. And would you be okay with calling you back maybe two or three weeks from now to see if you have any questions? Sure. That would be great. Perfect. And I just have a couple of questions and I'll be out of your hair. Would it be helpful to learn about improving your Google rankings to gain more visibility and attract more clients? We do have someone that we work with, or SEO, and Google listings. So I don't believe we're in them. Got it. And are you at this time satisfied with how your website looks and performs? Would you say it looks good or anything like that? Well, you know, we could always, we're always wanting to modernize it a little bit. We did just have that person do a bit of like a redesign on it. But yeah, you know, always, always... Perfect. And would you find value in having us create unique blogs and social media posts for you? Probably not blogs, but I think... Got it. No blogs, but yes, to social media. Alrighty. I'll go ahead and send that email. And I do hope we can do business with you in the future. I do thank you for your time. Take care. Great. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
