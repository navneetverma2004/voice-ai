 Hello, Spice. Hello, Spice. Hi. Yes? We're based here in Cooldown, specialized in selling and servicing a variety of inspection-related tools and equipment. But more importantly, we sell and service 3D printing typically used for fixturing jigs and prototypes. Uh-huh. And so are you currently utilizing 3D printing? We are. Okay. So we provide a range of professional 3D printers in various sizes, speeds, and capabilities, allowing printing with polymers, composites, and metal. So we represent a range of filament and resin-based professional 3D printers. Uh-huh. And so our printers come in various sizes, speeds, and capabilities, like I was saying, allowing printing with polymers, composites, and metal. And our systems are used for jigs, fixtures, prototypes, and custom parts in diverse applications. What kind of workflow are you using your 3D printing for? For typing. What would you say? Yes, for prototyping. Okay. Are you partnered? Do you work with a third party, like a third party vendor? Yes. Okay. Yeah, because that was because, you know, we provide sales and service. So I was going to see if you'd be open to comparing, you know, cost and process. So do you guys do the contract printing? Yes. Yeah. You'd be interested in that. Okay. So what we do is we just do a quick 15-minute production. Okay. And so would you have some time on, say, would you have a day this week or do you prefer next week? I don't know if you're going to be office on Friday the 4th, so we could maybe do like the 2nd, 88th. Yeah. Do you have something like maybe 8th, 30th on Friday? I could do. Let's see. Yeah, we could do it if you're already on Friday. And then, because we're going to send you a calendar invite for your email please. Correct. Okay. So read and then regal and then okay. Correct. And then EY. Okay. Yep. And then you're the technology manager? Yes. Okay. All right. So we will send you a calendar invite for a production for 3D printing for April 4th at 8.30. Okay. Sounds good. Let's work together. Great. Great. Thanks. Bye.
