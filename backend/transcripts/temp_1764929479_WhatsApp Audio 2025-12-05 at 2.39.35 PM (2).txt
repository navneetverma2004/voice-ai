 Hey, my name is Pam with Windows. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm doing well. Hey, are you still on a storefront? Yeah. Okay, so we turn your office window into an interactive display that shows your MLS listings in real time so people walking by can browse homes and contact your agents right on the spot. Are you currently doing any window based marketing in your storefront right now? Just the static, you know, flyers in the window. Okay, perfect. So the way it works with us is we'll handle everything from start to finish. Our team would fly out and saw the floor-mounted cabinet and touch screen and set up hanging displays customized for your window layout. I'm actually... Do you have a decent amount of foot traffic right now? I don't know what these...that means, but I mean, from my size, this town, yeah. Alright, so I'm just going to set you up with this thing with our VP so he could show you how it would look for your storefront. Are you available on Monday by chance? How much does it cost? Let me see if I got any pricing. Hold on. I'm going to appointment set her here. It says that a lot of clients offset the cost with our sponsorship program. We help secure local partners that you probably already have to buy AdPLAS on the system. Essentially, I guess, making a pay for itself. I will write to the manager that you want pricing right off the bat in his demonstration. Is your email still in? Yes. Alright, let me get you some that put down. And the number I called you on is your direct line? Would you call? It's the number I... Well, my office... It doesn't matter. Yeah, that would... Okay, I see that. Okay, got it. Okay, and then can we do Monday at one thirty? Second. What is that, 24th? Yes, it is. I don't see anything. I thought I had something, but I don't see it on there. So, it should be okay. Alright, let's do... Okay, so Monday 24th, one thirty, you're... Alright? I am. I will get you this confirmation right to your email. That way it pops up on your calendar. You'll probably get a call on Friday just confirming the time. So, good. So, if that other thing comes up, just let us know and we'll move you around. Okay? Okay. Alright. Yep, I got you set up for Monday, November 24th at one thirty p.m. We will talk to you then. You're very welcome. Have a good week. You too. Bye.
