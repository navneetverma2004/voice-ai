 Hey, my name is Sam with WINDOW. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm doing well. Hey, are you still on a storefront? Yeah. Okay. So we turn your office window into an interactive display that shows your MLS listings in real time so people walking by can browse homes and contact your agents right on the spot. Are you currently doing any window based marketing in your storefront right now? Just the static, you know, flyers in the window. Okay, perfect. So the way it works with us is we'll handle everything from start to finish. Our team would fly out and saw the floor mounting cabinet and touch screen and set up hanging displays customized for your window layout. I'm actually, do you have a decent amount of foot traffic right now? I don't know what these that means, but I mean from my size, this down, yeah. All right, so I'm just going to set you up with this thing with our VP so he could show you how it would look for your storefront. Are you available on Monday by chance? How much does it cost? Let me see if I got any pricing. Hold on. I'm an appointment setter here. It says that a lot of clients offset the cost with our sponsorship program. We help secure local partners that you probably already have to buy ad plus on the system. Essentially, I guess making a pay for itself. I will write to Joe here that you want pricing right off the bat in his demonstration. Is your email still in? Yes. All right, let me get you some that put down. And the number I called you on is your direct line. What did you call? It's the number. Well, my office, it doesn't matter. Yeah, that was. Right, I see that. Okay, got it. Okay, and then can we do Monday at 1.30? Second. What is that, 24th? Yes, it is. I don't see anything. I thought I had something, but I don't see it on there, so it should be okay. All right, let's do. Yeah. Monday, November 24th, 1.30, your. I am. I will get you this confirmation right to your email. That way it pops up on your calendar. You'll probably get a call on Friday just confirming the time. So good. So if that other thing comes up, just let us know and we'll move you around. Okay. Okay. All right. Yeah, I got you set up for Monday, November 24th at 1.30pm. Okay. We will talk to you then. You're very welcome. Have a good week. You too. Bye.
