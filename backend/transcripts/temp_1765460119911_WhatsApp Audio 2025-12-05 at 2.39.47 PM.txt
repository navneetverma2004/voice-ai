 Thank you for calling. If you know your party's three digits extension, please dial it now, followed by the pound key. For... Press 7. For finance, press A. Transferring your call. Hello? Yes. Hey, welcome to the Spaceship. So we're based right here in Cleveland. We specialize in selling and servicing a variety of inspection-related tools and equipment from cylindrical gauging, precision hand tools to optical comparators and vision systems. Okay. And then additionally, we sell and service 3D printers typically used for fixturing jigs and prototypes. Are you currently utilizing 3D printing? Yeah, we have a... I'm trying to think of the model. We just bought it, I think, a couple years ago. Okay. I think it's a S7. Trying to think of the name. Okay. Okay. Okay. And you bought it about two years ago? Yeah, about, I think it was... It was two or three years ago. Okay. We just bought it. Okay. I think it's an S7. Yeah. Okay. Are you using it... Like what kind of workflow? Are you using it for like prototyping, fixturing? Yeah. Yeah, so like prototyping because we... For, I mean, fixturing for holding products is a different variety. Fixturing for holding products? Okay. Yep. And then, just so you know, because we do sales and service, we have a range of professional 3D printers in various sizes, speeds and capabilities, allowing printing with polymers, composites and metal. Okay. And so we represent... Also offering a range of filament and resin-based professional 3D printers. Okay. And so I was like I was saying, they come in various sizes, speeds and capabilities allowing printing with polymers, composites and metal. And then our systems are used for jig fixtures, prototypes and custom parts and diverse applications. Are you currently working with a third party for your 3D printing or are you doing all on-house? We do outsource this sometimes depending on like the complexity of what we need to print our printer. It does, so it's got certain capabilities. So I can't think of the name of the company. I know we do have one. You have outsourced with one company? Yeah, I think it's just one right now. Is that for certain capabilities? Like you said, that maybe that your current technology doesn't perform? Yeah, they print down to like the micron. I forgot, like a lower micron for really like tight tolerances. Print down to a lower micron, that's what you use the third party for? Yeah. Okay. All right. Yeah, so like I said, we're really good resource for 3D here and like I said, we're based in around here. So yeah, we're really good resource for 3D printing. So I was going to see, just so you have like a backup vendor and we can just want to see if you'd be open to, even if you don't even have any current needs right now, but just so always good to do a little homework for the ahead of time, would you be open just doing like a quick introduction on 3D printing? Would you have some time? Yeah, did you guys, did you send something through my email? I might have gotten something. I could check it out because, yeah, we're always open like adding new vendors, just sort of like expanding what we have. Awesome. Yeah, we love to have the opportunity, you know, to, you know, if you're always open to it. And like I said, we just do like a quick 15 minutes as an introduction and then you know, we get more specific than just doing an email and then you can actually ask some questions and things like that.

What's a good spot for you? Probably afternoon would work the best. Okay. Two o'clock? That sounds fun. Okay. And then you the, what is your title at the company? My position is a test engineer. Okay. Test engineer. Okay. And then, and then your email because we're going to send you a calendar invite and a link for the. It's. You ready? Yes. It's. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, it's. Correct. Okay. Great. So, we will, we'll send you over a calendar invite for a three printing introduction for the 18th to two o'clock. Cool. We look forward to it. Have a great rest of the week. All right. You too. All right. Thanks. All right. Bye-bye. All right. Thanks. Thanks. All right. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
