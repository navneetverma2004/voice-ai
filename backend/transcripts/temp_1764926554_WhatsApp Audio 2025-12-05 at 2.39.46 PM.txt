 Hello and thank you for calling. Press 9 for the main office, Marques 3 for el español, or please stay on the line for other options in English. To reach the receptionist in the main office of the school, please press 2. To speak with the business and operations manager, please press 3. Hello, good morning. Good afternoon. Hi. Hi. Hi. What's the company? Okay. So we specialize in helping cut costs for charter schools from the unemployment tax while saving an average of 40%. And we're doing a survey to see if you can benefit from a solution that saves 40% on your unemployment taxes. So I was going to see if you had a minute to answer a couple of questions. And what was the name of your company again? Just a couple of questions. I'm not sure if I can answer them. I mean, I could try. Okay. I mean, they're pretty basic. You know, because even if your unemployment taxes are pretty low and you have a low tax rate, we have worked with schools where we can get you down to a 0% tax rate. So is your organization paying the state unemployment insurance tax each quarter or are you guys self-insuring your claims? Oh, well, that's a really good question. I want to say whenever I do the audits, I believe we have it on a quarterly basis. Okay. So when you do the audits, it's on a quarterly basis. Okay. Okay. And then number two, how many, currently does your group use a third party for your unemployment insurance taxes? Yes. Okay. Number three, roughly how many employees does your school have? 36. 36? Yes. Okay. And then how many locations does your school? One. The one. Okay. And then almost done here, does your school use an outside business consultant? Yes. Okay. And then is the school website is... That's correct. Okay. So, okay, great. So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to put the information together and then send it over to you. What is your email list? And the information that you're sending to me, that is going to include figures that you are proposing that we would be looking at as far as the tax rate for workers comp. Yes. Yes. So, like I said, so we just like, you know, we've just got to summarize the questions here and then... And then, you know, and then that... And then we're going to, you know, send you an email and then... Yeah, because like I said, even if you have... Even if you have a low tax rate, you know, we're able to get schools down to zero percent tax rate. May I ask another question though, Patrick? What schools do you work with in our area? Yeah. So we're based... Yeah. So we work with schools... We work with schools, you know, throughout the state. Do you have any specific ones that are close to us? We can... He's a gentleman who's going to be reaching out to you. I mean, he can get more specific with references. I mean, I know he'll be more than happy to discuss references with you. I don't know any... I don't know any on top of my head. But I know... Okay. But I know he'll discuss references with you. Yeah, because I normally do check out those things before I make any kind of switch with our school. Then there's contractors, things like that. Like it's just... I'd rather check with some folks that have been working with a specific company for a while and I want to get their take and their feedback on their satisfactory level or unsatisfactory level for these types of businesses. Yeah. Not that... Yeah. I mean, of course, you always want to do your due diligence. That's why... I mean, he'll be more than happy to discuss references with you. No problem. Yeah. Yeah, that's not a problem at all. Yeah, we're just... Yeah, our information is on the website. So you're welcome to send that to me. All one. Okay. So... That's correct. Are you the business manager? I am. Okay. And then, like I said, if you want to get... And then what we do is just kind of, again, be happy to... He's going to be sending the email. He'll be happy to discuss references and he just does like a review with you. Okay. So would you have some time on... You know, just discuss the email and our services in further detail. Would you have some time on the 20th Wednesday to talk with him? I was thinking, you know, if you could do late morning, afternoon, is there a good slot for you on the 26th? On the 26th, I would not have anything available until the afternoon. I am still... Yeah, the afternoon is the only time that I can see because the morning I have a meeting that's going to take the entire... Okay. Do you prefer two o'clock or three o'clock? Two o'clock would work better. Okay. Okay, great. Like I said, it's going to be... He's going to be... He'll send you an email and then it's a Zoom call. So he'll send you a calendar invite and a link for the 26th at two o'clock. All right. All right, we look forward to it. Have a great rest of your day. You as well. Bye. Bye-bye.
