Are you the person in charge of the fleet of the vehicles? Yeah. Okay. So we're calling to see if you'd be interested in learning more about the discount you received for starting a fleet account. Like, do you currently have a fleet account? No, most of our guys just Bluetooth and stream, so we probably wouldn't be interested, but... Okay, they Bluetooth and stream? Yeah. Okay. I mean, do your drivers currently... Like, do you typically manage driver benefits like this at a fleet level, or do your drivers handle subscriptions individually? No, they handle them individually. Okay. Could you be surprised? Because the fleet account's very cost-effective. If you just want to kind of do like an extra kind of perk for your drivers, it's very affordable, like, after the free trial period. Can I at least just send you an email about it? Yeah. So, if I just send you an email, would it be okay if I gave you a call back on Wednesday? If you could make it Friday, Wednesday is our orientation day. Okay, for Friday the 18th? Okay. So, and you said your Eastern time? Okay. I'll give you a call back at 11 a.m. on Friday. And so I'll send you an email and an invite to talk about the email for Friday at 11 a.m. And then just before I let you go, do you offer your drivers benefits such as free service? Well, we let them do their own currently, but we do offer it because it's in the truck. Okay, so you let them do your own currently, but you do offer it. Okay, great. Right. Okay, great. So, we'll send you an email and then a calendar invite to talk about it, about our fleet account. Okay. All right. We'll talk to you then. All right. Thanks, guys. Thanks. Thanks, Tom.
