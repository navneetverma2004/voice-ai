 Call Center Phone Company. Roll Play Call. Call Number One. Call Center Agent and Customer. Hello. Thank you for calling Buenophone. My name is Mariel. How may I help you today? Hi. Sorry. Is your name Mary Ellen? No, sir. My name is Mariel. Oh, I'm sorry about that, Mary Ellen. Okay. I got it. That's quite alright, sir. How may I assist you? Well, I'm wondering why my data usage has been so high the past few months. Alright, sir. Let me see if I can help you with that. May I have your telephone number, please? Yeah. It's 619-294-5637. Thank you, sir. And may I please have your first and last name? My first name is Steve, and my last name is English. The spelling is English, like the language, sir? Yes. That's correct. Okay, Mr. English, could you please verify your date of birth? Sure. It's June 10, 1998. Thank you, sir. June 10, 1998. I am pulling up your account, Mr. English. Alright. Sounds good. Here we are. Let's see. Yes, it does show that your data usage has increased over the past three months. That's why I'm calling. Sir, could you tell me what kind of phone you're using? I'm on an Android. I'm on has the same meaning as I have an Android. Or you could say I'm using an Android. I see. Do you often watch videos or download large files? No, not that often. That's why it's a bit of a mystery to me. Okay, Mr. English, thank you for that. Do you think there is something wrong with my phone? I'm not quite sure, but let me check something out for you. May I put you on hold for a few minutes? Sure. No problem. Thank you, Mr. English. Hello, sir. Thank you for your patience. Could I walk you through a few steps in the settings on your phone? Can I check my phone while I'm talking with you? Yes, sir. You can put me on speakerphone and still be able to check the settings on your phone. Okay, I'll give it a try. Could you find the settings on your phone? Yeah, I think so. Hold on a sec. Settings. Yeah, here it is. I got it. Excellent, sir. Next, select settings and then look for data usage. Give me a second data usage. Okay, I hit that. What's next? The expression I hit that has the same meaning as I chose that. Or you could say I selected that. After that, you are looking for cellular data usage. Right. Let me scroll a bit. Where is that? Yep. Found it. Sir, if you click on that button, it should show you which apps use the most data on your smartphone. Click on is an expression that means select. Oh, I never knew this was here. I guess I do use a few social media sites. That's all right, sir. Is there anything else I can do to lower my data usage? Well, sir, you could try to use Wi-Fi networks at home and at work. Also, you could try connecting to Wi-Fi while you are outside your home or workplace. I see. But is that safe? Your home network and workplace should have passwords. However, I cannot guarantee that it will be 100% secure. Also, you may want to refrain from sending personal information using public networks. Yeah, I don't send anything important using public Wi-Fi. Do you have any other advice on ways I can use less data? Let me see. If your calendar contacts and email sync every 15 minutes, that may drain your data. How can I check that? Have a look under Settings, then choose Accounts and set your email, Calendar and Contact Apps to sync data every few hours, or set them to Only Sync when connected to Wi-Fi. Hold on. Let me find that. Settings and then Accounts. That's correct, Mr. English. Take your time, sir. Accounts. Aha! I was set on 15 minutes. I'll be darned. Are you able to set it to 2 or 3 hours or only on Wi-Fi? Yes. Hold on. I think so. Setting it to 3 hours. Cool. Very cool. That should help you, Mr. English. If you follow those steps, it should lower your monthly data usage. That's awesome, Maryl. You've been a huge help. My pleasure, sir. Is there anything else I can assist you with today? No. I think that'll do it. Thank you, sir. One more thing. Would you mind staying on the line to answer a brief survey after our call is completed? No, I don't mind. You've been great. It's the least I can do. Thank you so much, Mr. English, and thank you for calling BuenoPhone. Thanks so much for your help. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye, Maryl. Call Center Phone Company. Call number 2. Call Center Agent and Customer. Hello. Thank you for calling single-step mobile. This is John speaking. How may I assist you? Hello. I bought a new phone a few months ago, and recently I noticed that the screen got cracked. All right, ma'am. Could you please tell me your phone number? Yes, hold on. I actually have to look that up. Here it is. It's 415-521-0851. Thank you for that. May I have the name on your account, please? Yes, it's Carol Holmes. Thank you, Miss Holmes. Pardon me. How do you spell your last name? It's H-O-L-M-E-S. That's H-S-N-H-O-T-L, O-S-N-O-S-G-R-L-S-N-L-L-M-S-N-M-I-K-E-S-N-E-K-O-N-S-N-C-R-A. Is that correct? Yes, that's right. Thank you, Miss Holmes. Am I covered for insurance for the cracked screen? Let me pull up your account information. This should only take a few seconds. Oh, I really hope I'm covered for this. Let me see. You bought this phone at our Novato store. You have the full insurance package, which is coverage for one year. This does include any damage to your screen. Oh, great. How do I get it replaced? You will need to bring the phone into one of our authorized repair stores along with a picture ID. A picture ID equals a photo ID. It usually has your picture or photo along with your address. Will my driver's license be okay? Sure. That'll be fine. How do I find an authorized repair store? I will send you a text message with a listing of those repair stores in just a little while. Great. Do you know how long it will take to get the screen repaired? Each repair store will have different times depending on the number of orders. Can you give me an estimated time? It generally takes approximately 30 to 60 minutes to repair a phone screen. Thanks. That gives me a better idea. Do you happen to know their hours? The repair store hours may vary by location. We recommend that you check the website of the store for their business hours. Okay. I can do that. Did you receive the text message I sent? Yes. I just got it. Thanks for that. Is there anything else I can help you with today? No. I'm good. So glad I have insurance for this phone. Yes. Our insurance plan is the best in the industry. Thank you very much for calling, ma'am. Thanks for your help. My pleasure, Miss Holmes. Goodbye. Goodbye. Remember to watch our other roleplay videos. Thank you.
