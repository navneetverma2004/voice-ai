 Okay. Hey, Mr. Sable. Hang on. Hey, this is... We have businesses like yours decrease their energy usage as well as improve their efficiency through tailored energy projects. Do you have someone looking into ways to help you save on your utility expenses or consider using a third party? Not at the moment. No, not at the moment. Okay. We'd like to tell you a little more about this. We do have 12 years of experience in the energy industry and a little bit about it. So we'll look at your utility bill for you. It says ways in how you're using your energy and then come up with ways to help save as well. We do also use tax incentives that help pay for your projects that you may have upcoming. What's a good email address? I can have some general information sent over for you. So let's see. I'll give you a little more about it. Yes. So I'll have time for a call. I do have a little more time to go through. Okay. And do you... No problem. I'll do... If you have an email need then that'll be great and we can follow up. Yes. And also, do you operate multiple facilities or is it just one? Just one. Just one? Okay. And then I'll get this email put in there if you want a moment. Okay. And would you also be open just to a quick meeting with our manager Matt? He'll be able to review that bill for you and also the saving options as well. I do have Tuesday the 28th available. Is there a particular time that may work best for you? No. I'd probably need to do it the week after that. Anywhere from Tuesday on. Okay. I can do... I have Wednesday, February the 5th. That would work. Okay. I'm going to do mornings, afternoons, I wish we'd work best for you. Afternoon. Okay. I have one to one-thirty? Yes. That'll work. Okay. And then I'll... Anyone else we need to invite? That's me. Okay. So again, I have you scheduled Wednesday. It'll be Wednesday, February 5th from one to one-thirty. And then I'll get that general information and the invitation sent over to you as well. Okay. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Bye-bye.
