 Hello? Hello, yes, this is going to get in contact with the person in charge of your finance. Okay, how can I help you? Yeah, awesome. Yeah, so help turn insurance expenses into assets for companies. And our process makes it easier for you to cut your insurance premiums by 30 to 40%. What we do is that we create millions of dollars in value for our clients every year via captive insurance. So, you know, are you familiar with captive insurance? I want to hear a little bit, yeah. Okay, yeah. It's pretty much just to give you a little bit more detail, is that captive insurance is when a business starts its own mini insurance company. Instead of paying a big insurance company to protect them, and they use their own insurance to cover risks. We actually have our own captive insurance. That's how much we believe in it. So, I would like to set up a quick phone call with our president. We do have some availability as well for next week, like Thursday or Friday, around 12 PM, is that where you email? Yeah, go and we have an extra this week. I'd like to hear about it, but I'm having lunch right now. Okay, I got you next week, Thursday on the 10th at 12. That sounds good for you? Yeah, send me a text or something until I know what's going on. Yeah, we'll send over an email. We'll send over email. Thank God, you are the president of the company, right? Correct. Awesome. All right, thank you so much. Appreciate it. Look at this.
