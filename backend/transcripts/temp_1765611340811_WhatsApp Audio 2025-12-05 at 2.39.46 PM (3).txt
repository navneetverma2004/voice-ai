 Hello, and thanks for calling. If you know your party's extension, you may dial it at and speak with a representative. Please hold the line. Hello, I'm trying to get the person in charge of... Oh, that would be me. Okay, is this okay? We're the largest independent armored car company in the... And since 1985, we've provided secure, reliable cash logistics for your industry with the latest securities features and a fully trained team. The purpose of my call is to see if it would make sense for a partnership, and I have just a few questions. Is that okay to ask you have time right now? Sure, sure. I can answer some questions. All right, great. Is your current cash-in transit provider reliable, and do they show up on a scheduled day? Yes. Okay, and are they securely transporting your cash with armored garves or armored vehicles? Yes. All right, and are they SOCQ compliant? I'm sorry, are they doing what for compliance? Are they SOCQ compliant? I don't know. Okay. And are they charging market cash-in transit prices for each delivery, or do you feel that you're being overcharged? So, let me explain that. That's a good question. So our cash carriers also own our ATM and our cashless ATMs. So, as you may know, we get a kickback from the ATM and cashless ATM transactions. So, typically, that more than covers the cash pickup. So, typically, like I would say, I might get a bill for like $17 once a quarter for the cash pickup. Okay. All right. And can I get your email? Sure. And is that... That is, yes. Okay. All right. Well, I thank you, and based on your answers, I think it would make sense to have a quick Zoom meeting with our... If this would work for you, are you open to this? I am. However, let me just be upfront and transparent with you. Our bank only allows us to use their approved carriers. So, I'd have to see if you were on that list. Yes. So, like when we found our courier, it was because we had an option between, you know, like three that they gave us. All right. So, would you be available then next Wednesday, the 12th? Yeah. Okay. Are you available in the afternoons, mornings or late afternoons? Yeah, I said late afternoons. It's probably best. So, like two o'clock, would that work? Yeah. Okay. And you are Eastern Time Corrupt? Yes, I am. All right. Thanks. And I have your email. Yes. And I have you down for Wednesday, the 12th at 2 p.m. And again, this will be just a quick Zoom meeting with... And then, he can go over everything with you and show you everything and then let you know if, you know, we would be able to help you. All right. Sounds good. All right. Well, I thank you so much. And you have a wonderful day. Thanks. You too. You bet. Bye-bye.
