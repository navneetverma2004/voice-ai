 I'm kind of healthy. Hey, I'm calling with the... I just... Yeah, I missed... This is she. Yeah, I was calling to give some information. I'm with the... We build custom outdoor and digital digital escape adventures for, like, new student and family programs. Mm-hmm. So it's basically a fun and interactive team-based adventure in a style... Have you guys done any, like, any escape room or virtual reality type programming? So we have not in our pocket of programming, but if you have some information that you could send over digitally, that would be perfect, and I can take a look. Yeah, what's a good email for you? It's... Perfect. I can definitely get some information sent over to you then. Wonderful. So basically, all the students would do is just download our app, and then they can play right on... And it takes very little time for you guys to plan it, because we do customize it. So it kind of coincides with your semester. Okay. This is a way for them to learn campus and all that thing, sort of things. So I'll get that information sent out to you. Did you have some time later this week or next week just to sit down for 15 minutes? The next week will probably be... Yep, next week will probably be a little bit better. Okay. Pretty flexible, with the exception of Mondays and Wednesdays. Okay. Did you want to do it Tuesday? Tuesday will be fine. Okay. What's a good time for you? Like, mornings or afternoons? Let's see what my Tuesday looks like. Morning would be good. Okay. I do have a 10-15 or 11, if that works for you. 10-15 works. Okay. Perfect. Well, I'm going to go ahead and get this inviced and sent over, so it goes to your calendar, so you don't forget about it. Okay. And the meeting will be with our CEO. So basically, just pull up the program so you can see it, just to see if it's something that could work for you. Okay. And you said you've never done anything like this. What kind of events do you guys typically plan for your department? So we don't do a lot of the bigger events. We used to do, what was the name of that? Goodness. It was like big icebreakers. I can't remember the name of the company, but they would come in and it was during our new student orientation, and it was programmed to allow the students to connect and become familiar with each other. And that was the last big thing on that caliber that we've done. Okay. Makes sense. Well, yeah, this will be a little different. Like I said, it's not us coming out to your location, so it's just something you guys are able to do on your own, and it's something you can reuse yearly as well. Okay. So I'll go ahead and get that. You said... That is correct. Okay. Perfect. And then you are... Yes, I am. So you are... Okay. Let me go ahead and change that. Okay. For Tuesday, you said 10-15. 10-15, yes, ma'am. Okay. Perfect. Well, I'll get that advice sent over to you for that Tuesday. Okay. And then we'll just go from there and see if it's something that could work for you guys maybe for next semester. Sounds great. Thank you so much for your call. Of course. Have a good one. You too, bye-bye.
