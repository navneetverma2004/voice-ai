 Yes, I was trying to reach the person in charge of business development or maybe marketing. He's not in, but you're like, oh wait, he might be in the business. Hi, I'm just wondering if you have any questions. Yes, sir. We specialize in helping law firms increase their online presence, which makes it easier for potential clients to find you and decrease your income. And just a little bit about what we do. We provide outstanding customer service, so we help to give you ranking to attract more clients. We understand working with law firms with our experience of over 20 to 30 years. And the purpose of my call was to see if you would be open to just a quick Zoom meeting to give you a visual perspective and see if it's something that will work for you guys. If you have some time, maybe next week or? Oh yeah, I do have time even next week or the week after, with the exception of Monday the 17th. Okay, how about today is Tuesday, so you want to do maybe next Tuesday the 18th? Oh yes, that'd be perfect. Okay. And usually late mornings or afternoons work best for me. Okay, and you're on Eastern time, right? Oh, correct, yep, more than that. So you said mid mornings? Oh yeah, mid mornings throughout the afternoon would probably be best. Okay, how does maybe 11.30 sound? That'd be perfect. And do you have my email? That's what I was about to add. What is your email address? And what was your first name? Yes. Okay, and what's your name? Oh yeah, marketing coordinator. Oh, okay. Sounds good. So I got you down for Tuesday, March 18th at 11.30 a.m. Perfect. Yep, and always that the, you know, the calendar invite when it comes in. Yes, I'll be sending that over. And while I have, would it be helpful to learn more about improving your rankings to gain more visibility? And while I have, would it be helpful to learn more about improving your rankings to gain more visibility and attract more clients? Oh yeah, we definitely focus a lot on organic search. So yes, definitely like the website is, I always say it's like a living document. That's something that's not static. That is correct. Okay, are you satisfied with how your website looks and performs now? There's always areas of improvement. It's not a static thing. It's a very dynamic marketing tool and communications platform. So yeah, always looking at ways to, you know, improve a little more. We do do some paid, but not a lot. Just mostly like a little service ads, but that's about it in terms of like paid search or paid social. Juan, the other side. Gotcha. Would you find value in having us create unique blogs and social media posts for you? Yeah, so I handle a lot of the social media, and we do have a blog session, but definitely always interested in hearing like different sorts of content to help maximize the outreach. Okay. Far enough, and is this going to be the best phone number to reach you? Yeah, and I'll put my, I'll respond back so my direct line will be there. I think you called the main line. Okay, yeah, let me get you the right line. That's usually how people usually dial in anyway. So let me just bear with me for just a moment. This is actually technically different for an external call than an internal one. So, yep. Gotcha. Okay. It's been a pleasure. We'll definitely be sending you over a link just to confirm that time for the Zoom meeting. And again, I have you down for Tuesday, March 18th at 11.30 a.m. your time. Okay, for Eastern time. Perfect. I'm just going to go a little chuck into, yep, I'm definitely free that time. Okay. Sounds good then, Dave. Thank you so much for taking my call, and you take care. You too. Have a great weekend too. You too, love. Thank you. Bye-bye.
