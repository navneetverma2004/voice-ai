 Call Center, handling rude customers, role play. Call number one, product delivery delay. Call Center agent and customer. Thank you for calling Single Step Customer Service. My name is Carol. How can I assist you today? Finally, took you long enough to answer. I ordered a package and it's not here yet. What the hell is the problem with you people? I selected expedited delivery. I'm very sorry to hear about the delay with your package. I'll do my best to help. May I have your order number please? Ugh, fine. It's 583-6002. Thank you. I appreciate your patience. Let me check the status of your order. I see that your package is currently in transit, but there have been weather delays. It should arrive by the end of the week. I understand the urgency and I do apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. This is totally unacceptable. I needed it yesterday. Your company is the worst. I completely understand your frustration and I apologize for the inconvenience. I'll contact our shipping department right away to ensure they prioritize your delivery. Additionally, I'll provide you with regular updates via email. Is there anything else I can assist you with? Whatever, just fix it. I need it as soon as possible. I can't believe I trusted you people to deliver this on time. I'll make sure we resolve this issue promptly. If you have any more concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Reach out? What good will that do me? Again, I am sorry about the delay. We occasionally experience shipment delays during the holiday season. Then why do you offer expedited shipping? It makes zero sense. I will certainly pass that along to our management team. I appreciate your suggestion. Ha! I could probably run your company better than the idiots you have in charge. Is there anything else I can help you with, sir? No, I'm done. I really don't want to call you people ever again. I can understand your frustration, sir. Please check for the email updates from our shipping department. Oh, I'll be checking. Thank you again for calling Single Step Customer Service. Blah, blah, blah, whatever. Save your salutations for someone else. Thank you, sir. Goodbye. Call Center, handling rude customers, call number two, billing dispute. Call Center agent and customer. Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Single Step Customer Service. My name is Patrick. How may I assist you today? Finally, someone answers. I've been overcharged on my bill. What are you people doing? I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing billing issues. I'll do my best to help. Could you please provide me with your account number or the phone number associated with your account? This is ridiculous. It's 535-432-1. I'm sorry, ma'am. Is that your phone number? Yes, you asked for my phone number. May I also have the area code? It's 619. Thank you for providing that. May I confirm your last name, please? Don't you have it in the system? Yes, we do. However, I will need a verbal confirmation. It's Stapleton. Do you need me to spell it? No, that won't be necessary, Ms. Stapleton. I'll look into the billing discrepancy for you. I see the discrepancy in your bill and I apologize for any error. Let me correct that for you right away. It's about time. I can't believe I have to deal with this crap. Is this going to take long? This should only take a few minutes. I completely understand your frustration and I appreciate your patience. Oh, I see you were billed twice on the 21st. Is that correct? Yes, on the 21st and if you look closely, the same thing happened on the 26th. I do apologize for the billing error. Just give me a moment to adjust this for you. All right, I've adjusted your bill to reflect the accurate charges. You should see the correction on your next statement. Well, it's about time you people did something right. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I apologize for any inconvenience. If you have any more concerns or questions, please feel free to let me know. We value your feedback. Yeah, my feedback is that your company should buy a better billing system, so I won't have to call you to correct your mistakes. I will pass that along to our team. Is there anything else I can assist you with today? No, just fix your stupid computer glitch. The word glitch has the same meaning as malfunction or sudden error. We will look into the issue to ensure that it doesn't happen again. Yeah, that would be awfully nice since I have better things to do. I am fully aware of that, Ms. Stapleton. I hope we can provide better service for you in the future. Well, you better or I will take my business elsewhere. Do you understand what I'm saying? I do understand, ma'am. Is there anything else I can help you with today? No, we're done. I think I've made my point. Thank you again for being a single-step customer. Yeah, I hope you people appreciate that. We most certainly do. Have yourself a nice day. Yeah, right. Goodbye. Remember to watch our other role-play videos.
