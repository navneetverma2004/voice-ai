 Hey, how's it going? I was hoping to speak to the person in charge of security for the property. Okay, give me one second. Can I have Suze Carlin? Give me one second. Yep. What's the next step? We do safety and security measures. Just wondering if you guys are using a single security provider for your property? We currently have a security service. We are not looking for any security services. Okay, yeah, no worries. I'm just really here to kind of give some information and get our name out there. I was just hoping to maybe grab your email, send some information, even if it's just a back pocket solution, you know. Okay. Okay, so what's your email? So I'll get that information sent over to you, you know, kind of the way that it works is we provide safety and security solutions, securing a certain spot, and we do 24-hour support and streamlined services for property management. I'm going to get that information sent over to you. And then, you know, obviously the reason, you know, any shot that you might be open with one of our specialists should come in and kind of see if our security solutions would be a benefit to your property. Okay. So, you know, he's pretty open. You know, he's got a lot of availability with some time next week work, like a Tuesday. Um... That will not work. I will be in court all morning. Okay, so he's got Wednesday and Thursday available too, would that work? Thursday will be the best day for me. Awesome. I'll push it Thursday, figure around lunchtime. Would that work? 12 o'clock? Okay. Okay, awesome. And what was your name? That is correct. Okay. All right. Um, and then what was your physical address? That is correct. Okay. All right, awesome. All right. So I am going to put that in. You're going to get, um, just the invitation through your email just so we can confirm, but it's going to be January 24th, 23rd at 12 p.m. That's still okay? Okay. All right, awesome. Thank you so much. I look forward to seeing you soon. All right, bye-bye. Bye-bye.
