 Good afternoon Mrs. I was actually looking to get in contact with the person in charge of booking your tours with that video. Yes. Oh, awesome, absolutely. And you said your name was correct. That's what it ended for money. Correct. Awesome, yeah. So here what we do is that we specialize in helping tour operators boost their online bookings to fill capacity during weekdays and slower parts of the year. And our services integrate directly with your care and booking software so you don't have to scrap or get anything that you currently, you're rid of anything that you currently have. And really the purpose of my call is to see if you'd be open to a phone call with our director. He's going to go ahead and see if this could work for you. So are you guys currently at full capacity on your tours? We're just getting started this season. It's just starting right now. This is... Yeah, we are based out of, to be exact, we're out of...
