 Good morning, thank you for going to the Department of Health here. Yes, this is Terence B. Dach. Hi. Hi. Yes, this is... We offer a non-toxic dry cleaning system that cuts costs, eliminates hazardous waste, and includes full technical marketing support. Are you using a safety eco-friendly option for your dry cleaning system? What solvent are you using? Yeah, I don't know the exact solvent, but we... Well, it's hydrocarbon, so we use hydrocarbon. Oh, you're using hydrocarbon? You're a real car? Yeah. Okay, I don't know if you're familiar with... What thing is it like the Queen Show and any out and about? Oh, you have to use the Queen Show? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, because the way it works is a quick refresh. The way our solution is made from sure liquid silicone, which is an odorless non-toxic food that's also found in personal care products like air conditioner, sunscreen, moisturizer, and anti-aging products. Uh-huh. So it's guaranteed not to contaminate the property, it's not regulated by the... And so we're the only environmentally non-toxic option for dry cleaning. A lot of others are carbon-based and consider ground contaminant or volatile organic compounds. And then being environmentally non-toxic with our solvent allows you to eliminate hazardous waste and other regulatory expenses. Quick question, like how long have you been using hydrocarbon before? Well, we just switched our plants, so just a couple years. Okay, where were you some before? We were using Perk. You were using Perk? Yeah. Yeah, because we are replacing for Perk according to the dry cleaning and longitude and dependence studies done in the early 2000s. So I was going to... I mean, would you be open to... We just want to see if you just have your options open just to kind of... I know the last time you kind of reviewed our solvent. Would you just kind of see if you just be open? I mean, try sending an email about it? Yeah, use an email about it. Okay. And then, as I said, what is... Okay, and then, as I said, just so I can critique the email, you dry clean on the premises? Yes. Okay, and then the solvent... What solvent do you currently use? You said hydrocarbon, right? Yeah. Okay, I always have to ask this. Are you in the market for buying a newer used machine? Not currently. Okay, not currently. Okay, that's fine. Like I said, we just want to see you open to just to compare it to see if that's all. How many of the locations are planned? Only one. So it's just one location total, correct? Yep, one location. Okay, so one location. Okay, so you're... Right? Yes. Okay, so I'm going to send over an email. Would it be okay if I gave you a call back on Wednesday? Yep, yeah, that works for you, son. Okay, so I say, how's this time, 11.30? Yeah, that would work. Okay, perfect. And then I'll send you an email and a phone, and a calendar for a phone call for Wednesday at 11.30. Okay, that was good. We look forward to that. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you, you too. Bye. Thanks.
