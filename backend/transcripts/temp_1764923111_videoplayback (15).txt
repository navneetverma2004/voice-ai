 Hello. Hi, my name is... I was looking to speak with Shia or the business owner. Are they available? This is Shia. Hi, how are you today? I'm good. How are you? I'm good. Thank you. So, as I said, I'm calling with Shia. We're a small group of entrepreneurs that partner locally with businesses like yours with growth potential. We're different because we focus on maintaining your legacy, keeping your people, and providing flexible ownership transition. You can partially stay in the business, or if you choose to do so, we also offer options for a full or a partial cash out. Once an investment is made, your local entrepreneur assumes a full-time management role in your business. The reason for my call today is just to see if you would be open to a quick phone call with your local entrepreneur to still learn more about your business and provide the valuation to consider a partnership. Is this something you'd be open to? Yeah. Okay. Is there a good day in time for a quick 30-minute phone call? I'm kind of open right now, depending on when you're looking at. Yeah. I have some time tomorrow or next Tuesday. So, tomorrow's the soonest. What's a good time? What time tomorrow? Let's see. I have basically anywhere from 9.30 to 11. Can we do around 10? Yeah. I have a 10 a.m. at work. Perfect. Okay. Okay. So, I'm just going to make sure I have everything correct. The correct spelling of your name is, and then your last name. I'm going to try to pronounce it correctly. Hopefully, I, okay? Yes. Thank you so much. I hate mispronouncing, but I do it often. Okay. No, that's okay. No, it's beautiful, though. Thank you. And then I have, correct? Yes. All right. And what's a good email for you, Sean? It's okay. And then I'm going to make sure I have this stuff correct before I send over the confirmation for your phone call. And this is obviously a good number to reach you out to. Or do you have a, okay, perfect. This is perfect. And then are you near your computer or email, where if I send this to you, you can get that confirmation. Yes. Okay. I'm going to send it over now. I have you scheduled for tomorrow for your phone call at 10 a.m. with me. And that's Friday, July 18th for that phone call. And you should have received that. Oh, my God. All right. Perfect. And then just a few other questions just helps with the meeting to run a little bit smoother. Have you thought about selling your business? I have. Okay. And if you, are you looking to sell it within the next 18 months? I was thinking a little bit further out, but yeah, I'd be open. Perfect. All right. And then do you have a succession plan? I'm working on that right now. Okay. Perfect. And then have you had any prior conversations about selling with any other interested parties? No. Okay. Perfect. And that is it. You received that email, so you will, that phone call again tomorrow. And I appreciate all your time. Thank you so much. It was a great day. Okay. Thank you. You too. Bye-bye.
