 Good afternoon. Yes, sir. My name is... I'm actually calling with the... I was actually trying to reach the person that would be in charge of purchasing. That would be me. Yes, sir. Yes. And I do apologize. I don't think I got your name. I don't know. Hi. Again, my name is... I'm actually just calling with the... We are actually a local company that just manufactures hurricane impact doors with free delivery. The biggest thing about us is we know competitors will take three to four weeks to deliver. We actually deliver in as little as two weeks. Our portal actually lets you guys compare pricing, get instant quotes, and track orders and pay online. The purpose of my call is really just to see if you'd be open to me signing you up for our free account and then receiving a phone call from our office manager to ensure the access to your account. And what brands... What brands do you guys use? Let me take a look here. I know we have several different things that we use. Is there a certain brand that you're looking for? No. I mean, I have direct accounts with the dealers. So I'm just wondering what this is. Yeah. Well, again, so I'm calling with the... We have our actual own doors and everything that we use. Oh, you guys have your own impact windows and doors? Yes, sir. Okay. If you want, go ahead and send me an email with your information and I'll go ahead and look into that. Okay. I can do that. What's that best email for me to send that information to you? It's going to be... And that was at... Correct. Okay. I will send that information over to you. And if you're okay, we'll just reach out in a couple of weeks and just see if you got any questions. And again, if we can get you signed up then will that work for you? Yeah, sure. Yeah, I'll go ahead and look at it and we'll go from there. All right. Well, I appreciate your time today, sir, and you have a wonderful day. All right. Thank you, too.
