 Hi, this is Paul. Paul, how are you doing? I'm doing well, thanks. Yes, so following up to help you get set up with a direct-to-consumer framework. So it's a direct-to-consumer's quote form we developed that's at no code at no cost to you. So it's an instant-goes-pop-office quote form for free with no midterm audits. And we've added all lines of commercial coverage as well. I'll just fill in a little bit of hair. Sure. All right, so now how do I get into that? Okay, so this is, and for the reason I'm calling, so this is like a brief summary of it. So the way it works is we provide a simple tool that offers instant workers, comm, ghost policies on your site. You can be HB-texted, emailed, or linked to a QR code making it very easy to do. And then this will allow you to quote all commercial lines through our portal. What we do as a quick introduction, because we want to get into the questions and we can walk you through the tool, we do a 30-minute Q&A demo with my colleague, and then he can show you how in tour form works. So... I'm sorry, I don't have time to speak today. Not today. Yeah, I think it's a day next week. What day will be next week? Probably Tuesday, I think. Okay, that's the 15th, and of course you're... No, I'm not. I'm absolutely... Sorry, you're not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. No, I'm not. I'm absolutely... Sorry, yes, sorry. Yes, so we have some afternoon availability. Okay. Like two, three o'clock? That's absolutely fine. Okay, two o'clock, good? Yeah, that's fine. Okay, and then email that we have, because we're going to send your email. That is correct. That's my personal email. Okay, and then just before I let you go, do you want to... Is there anyone else in the HB you want to include in the demo? I don't think so. I think that's going to be fine for now. Okay, and then do you currently offer instant quotes on your website? I do not. Okay, and then I just have to add one more thing. So we are moving into some traditional policies, some life insurance policies. Do you want to include it in some... If we send out some information on that as well, do you just want to stay with... Just keep it commercial? I can do that. Well, what's the cost for this? For... Yes. Okay, well, they're going to... I mean, that's good to talk about on the demo. Okay. I just want to see if you'd be open to if we send some traditional policies, some life insurance policies for me. Yes, I can be... Okay, great. We'll include you in that as well. Okay, so we will send you a calendar invite for the ghost policy tool to show you for April 15th at 2 o'clock. Okay. Alrighty. Thank you. Have a good weekend. Thanks. Thank you. Bye.
