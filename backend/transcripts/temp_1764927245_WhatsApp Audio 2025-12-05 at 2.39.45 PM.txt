 Yes, hi. Can you hear me? Hello. Yeah, hi. I'm looking for the person who's trying to production, please. Who's this? What company are you calling? I'm... Oh, hi. Yeah, I'm actually on vacation today. I'm not in the office. Oh, okay. No, okay. I'm sorry about that. If you want to try our main number in AF... Yeah. Yeah. I appreciate that. No problem. And you're the VP. And then what was that? Sales manager. Okay. No worries. Yeah. The reason I was... Maybe you could just give me a little context. We do a tool in software to streamline kind of the reporting from your... ...d-machines. Oh, so you're not looking for anything to be manufactured? Oh, I'm a salesperson. Yeah, yeah, no. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I misunderstood then. Oh, good. I was looking for the person who's trying to produce the product. Oh, good. I was looking for the person who's trying to production just... And I understand you're on vacation. So would there be someone else to speak with about that? Just kind of helping, say, productivity... No, actually, our engineer manager is out and we actually have implemented a software two years ago to do all of what I think you're trying to sell us. Well, it could be... It could even complement. It depends on what it is. And that's why we're calling it. There's no pressure in anything just to kind of educate and see where things are and no worries if not just to kind of do evaluations and see if there's a place for it or if you guys have things covered. So... Yeah, if you want to try me back tomorrow or early next week, try me in the office and connect then. Yeah. Okay. Is your email... Yes. Okay. Very cool. And so understood. So yeah, that's no problem. I mean, I'm just going to hit you on the phone. I could just... If it's okay, it's like Tuesday after... In the morning, okay? I don't have my calendar in front of me, but if you want to try later morning, that's probably good. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I could just have... I'm a sales development person here. I could have reached out. Okay. Yeah, yeah. And so he's our CEO. Just kind of get right to it. So I don't have to spend any more time with me. But understood. So I just have like... I could do like 9 or 10 a.m. That's okay. Actually, if you could do like 11 on Tuesday, that would be better. Okay. Very cool. And yeah, yeah, yeah. I will send that over. And just to help understand it, it basically gives you some visibility into the production floor. We're seeing it for some of your companies like yours, increased productivity a little is about three months or so. Does your current way you see machines give kind of a historic impact? So our system works is that we have connections to the machine and reports data live so we can see if the machines are running or not. It flows into our payroll software. All of our production planning, all of our metrics are all done through it. So it's called... I'm sure if you're familiar with it, but that's who we're using now. Yep. Okay. Very cool. Well, let me do this. I'll set it up with... And I won't even... I'll butcher your last name, but I know how to spell it. And then R and then I got your last name out. And we'll see you around 11 o'clock. I'll send it in right over. Okay. Thank you so much. Enjoy your forget. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
