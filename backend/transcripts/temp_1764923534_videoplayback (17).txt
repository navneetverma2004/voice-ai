 Thank you. My name is not a good time not a problem I've got some that's time next Friday next Friday the 23rd oh that is the 23rd not my bad yes next Friday the 23rd already and this might sound silly but you are in I can't tell you how many times I thought I was calling one place and turns out I was calling another so I like to double check. I have… Are you in? Yes, I am. Okay. I'm my managed service provider. How ironic. So, for the 23rd, I've got pretty much all day open. Do you prefer mornings, afternoons? Let's do the morning at, let's say, 10.30. I do have a 10.30 open. Is your email still… Yes. Fantastic. What I will go ahead and do then is get you an email sent out with a link to join that quick Zoom with…and he will be giving you that call on Friday, May 23rd at 10.30 Pacific Time. Okay, sounds good. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you. Have a good day. You too. Take care.
