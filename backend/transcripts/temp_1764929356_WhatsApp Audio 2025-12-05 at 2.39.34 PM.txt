 Office is in my position, so I can help you. This is... Can you speak to the person that would be in charge of family weekend? Um... Let me think. Sorry, would you explain that to me one more time so I can direct you to the right person? The person that would be in charge of, like, planning family weekend for events. Oh, family weekend events. Um, okay, let me think. Sorry, there's just a lot of people, and I don't want to have you doing the run around, so... I understand, I understand. I can tell you a little bit about what we do and see if maybe that'll help. Yeah, that'll help. Okay, what we do is we build custom indoor and outdoor digital escape adventures for colleges and universities. It's like a fun, interactive, team-based escape room adventure game that is done through an app in the style of, like, the best way to explain it. Okay, great. Let me put you on hold really quickly and see if our parent and family engagement coordinator is ready. Um, or available. He has a little job of planning stuff like that, so let me see if he's available to talk, and I'll be right back. Okay, thanks. Of course. Hello there, so there. Yes. Hi, this is Kyle, the parent and family engagement coordinator. I heard you had a question about family weekend. Yes, yes I do. How are you doing today? I'm good. I'm good. Thank you. Good. Okay. Well, good. I'm glad to hear that. My name is, and what we do is we work with colleges and universities to create custom team building events. Um, that may be a good fit for family weekend or other events that you may have planned. Um, it's like a fun, interactive, team-based self-guided escape room adventure game done through an app. It's kind of in the style of, if you're familiar with that. Okay. Um, we do, do you do any kind of escape room virtual reality type programming? We do. No, no. I'm happy. No, we're actually kind of going, undergoing some changes in our offerings for family weekend anyway, so I'm happy to get your name and number and kind of elevate it to my supervisors. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So, our, I can send you an email with some information, if that would help. What we do is, like all the students are, you know, there's no limit to how many players can play. You can reuse the event whenever you want to. It's just downloading an app and can play this team-based escape adventure right on campus. It takes very little time to plan about less than 30 minutes of your time to set up. We can customize it to any event that you're planning, so it coincides with, like, semesters, what have you. We've done, like, Halloween, scavenger hunt, spring day, welcome week events. And what I can do is I can send you an email with some information, if you don't mind. And that would be- Yeah, the good email is, if you're ready, I'll give you an email and it'd be nice to have that. Sure. Okay, the email is- I will make sure I have it right. Yeah, that's right. Okay, and what I'd like to do is have- to reach out to you next week and just do, like, a presentation, like, a quick quick- wait, 15 minutes. Are you available next Wednesday for him to do that? I'm not sure. If you want to send me that email just so we can get an overview of what you're offering us, maybe go from there if we wanted to decide to set up a time to chat. Okay, okay, great. May I have your last name just so I can have it for our record so we'll know who we're sending everything to? And you're the parent and family engagement coordinator? Yeah. Okay, well, I'll go ahead and get that email out to you and then maybe you can take a look at it and see if we can go from there. Okay, thanks. Talk to you next time. All right, thank you. Bye-bye.
