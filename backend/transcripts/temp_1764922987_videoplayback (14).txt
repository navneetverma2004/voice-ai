 Hello. Hi. My name is, I'm with the company. Hey, how are you? I'm doing well. How are you? Good. Fantastic to hear. We attend the NAMES conference annually as we do provide timekeeping automation software for the wireless construction industry. Did you get a chance to attend the conference this year? No, I was a... Fantastic. Any chance you were able to stop by the booth and speak with us? I don't remember offhand if I did or not. Not a problem. I did it in a rather brief interaction. Absolutely. It was a couple of months ago and your guys' field is pretty busy. Do you guys currently have a software that helps track your field employees and your field productivity? No, we're currently trying to migrate over to, I think it's called, it's the management software that we're trying to migrate over to. Okay, understood. So the way that it works is we reduce non-productive time. Your employees spend away from the job site. We don't need to replace any of your current systems, so we would not interfere with the migration to... We focus on time capture only. So we use DPS and geofencing to help track crew locations and automatically allocate daily hours to the proper job and activity codes. So your employees no longer have to manually indicate when they arrive at the site and select that proper job code. We also do integrate into most leading payroll systems. It helps payroll run quickly and more efficiently because HR is not having to go through and make a bunch of corrections for accidentally selecting code two instead of code four and vice versa. I was just calling to see if you would be open to a quick Teams meeting so you can show you what it looks like and the dashboard and how it works, see if it's something that would work out for... Yeah, I could definitely take a look at it. Fantastic. And just to confirm, I know it says you are in... But sometimes with certain companies, that's not exactly accurate. So you are in central time. Is that accurate? Yep, correct. We're located just north of... So I'm pretty familiar with the area. You guys are actually in pretty funny. I do have availability next Wednesday on April 9th. Do you have any times open then? Yeah, just a second. Let me put you on speaker and check my calendar. Absolutely. So it looks like I'm pretty open. I do have a meeting from 3 to 3.30. Besides that, I'm open. All right. Could I have pencil you in for 10.30? Yeah, sounds good. Fantastic. And is the email... Is that a good one for you? Yep, that'll work. Fantastic. And just to give you a little bit of heads up, do you guys typically have in the field today? I would say between 10 and 20. 10 and 20 crews or 10 and 20 people? People. Okay, I was like, oh, wow, that's... How do you guys manage that? All right. So I will go ahead and get that email sent over. It'll have your invite for that quick teams meeting with on Wednesday, April 9th at 10.30 a.m. Central time. All right, sounds good. Absolutely. Thank you so much for your time today. You bet. Goodbye. Bye.
