 Hello. Hi. My name is Paul. I'm actually... Yeah. Yes, sir. Again, my name is Paul. What we could do is we actually provide a timekeeping automation software for the wireless construction industry just to increase the time that your remote employees would spend at the job site. Did you happen to attend the...this year? I did. You did? Did you happen to see us while you were there? I'm trying to... There's a ton of stuff there, so I know it's always hard. Yeah, I can't remember where I'll stop my hand. Well, no worries. So what we do is we actually work to reduce the nonproductive time that your employees spend away from the job site. We don't replace like your current systems as we just focus on the time capture side. So this is automated so that your field employees actually just clock in and clock out and then the system actually allocates the time and everything for you guys. Really, the reason I'm reaching out is just to see if you'd be open to an email with some information and then Paul, with our co-founder, he can actually show you how it works and can be implemented. You can definitely send me an email and I can review that slash kind of pass it on to more of the team. I know we are kind of in the process of switching our own payroll and time tracking app right now. But yeah, I'd definitely be open to an email. I gotcha. What's the best place for me to send that to you yet? Yeah, the... So I'll send that over to you. Like I said, you'll just kind of be able to get a good idea of what it'll do. I know you said you guys are looking at switching up your timekeeping. Is there somebody specifically that you guys are swapping over to? I'm not too far into that side of it. I just know we're doing a new time tracking like payroll app. Gotcha. And taking it more just internal instead of being... Had like a third party doing this for our payroll and time tracking app. I gotcha. Okay. Yeah, it sounds like a lot of people actually inside the industry are starting to do that, you know, more in-house development and things of that sort. So what I'll do is I'll shoot that email over to you. If you're okay, I'll even just set up, we'll just reach out, you know, in the following weeks just to answer any questions you may have and then if it makes sense to set that call up. Is that okay? Yeah, that'll work. Okay. Well, let me do that for you. Appreciate your time today. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day, sir. Thank you, you too, sir. Bye. Bye. Bye.
