 This is the first one. This is with the property manager. That would be myself. Hi. I'm our local member of the Midlands. I provide full service to editorial cleanings for properties, apartments and property managers. This can include daily upkeep or one-time deep cleans, and they're all handled in-house. One thing about us is that we are not a franchise. Our team is local, trained, and invested in long-term client relationships, and all of our employees are W-2 staff and not subcontracted. We are a team that is focused on better accountability and quality control. We're calling this CACB Open to an in-person meeting with our technicians to provide you with a competitive quote and show you a sample demonstration cleaning kit to show you how we handle those common cleaning challenges. I actually do basically all my cleaning in-house with a caretaker. So I'm not interested right now. So... Okay. So you don't need anybody to help come in with deep cleans or turnovers or apartment turns, anything like that? You just do it all yourself? We handle it when you're on vacation. I think it's a lot of load for somebody. Yeah. I mean, I guess, how much are your turn clean, Cush? And... Yeah. Unfortunately, I don't have pricing information. What I can do is I can set you up with that in-person meeting. It wouldn't be today. Nothing like that. We're not going to bombard you last minute. What I'd like to do, because Thanksgiving is next week, is bring in your personal income. So I'd like to shoot for Friday the 4th, I believe it is. That way, we can just get him to come by. He'll give you a in-person quote. Even if we don't sign up, we don't expect you to come with your wallet out like the first day. We're not actually going to put the bill right away, anything like that. We just want to come by, give you that information, say, look here, for your apartment or for your deep cleans or whatever, here's what pricing info would be. There are another quote. All right. It would probably be just like turn clean. Yeah, of course. Once he comes in on the 4th, he can set that up with you, going over, you know, like I said, we do either or. We have different project types as well. So let me get your information. I'm starting to ramble. I apologize. What did you say your first name was? Can you sell it for me? Oh, okay. It sounded like you were saying it. And I was like, that's a very unique name, and I'm so afraid I'm going to misspell it. All right, let me get your last name. This is Doug. You, why? I D-I-N-U-R-E-P-R-O-P-R-T-E-M-A-N-A-J-E-R. All right. And then what's a good email address just to send that reminder to? Yep. Companiesplural.com. Okay. And then like I said, my goal is to shoot for the fourth because we got Thanksgiving. I don't know if you're a Black Friday shopper. I personally am not, but if you are, we don't want to overload you. I'm sorry, it's Thursday the fourth. What is a, what do you say to like a 930 in the morning? Is that too early or is that like a good time? Nope. That would be fine. Yeah, that would be fine. That is 938 central time. All right. So we'll come by and then we just need to verify the address I have. And that's in. All right. Perfect. So come back here. Slow down. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Looks like I have everything yet. I just want the address verified. So yeah, everything will be based on your properties need. And like I said, that local W2 team handles all the work, better consistency, accountability, whether it's ongoing or just getting a property movement ready. So that sounds like it should be something that we could, you know, definitely get set up with you. The address has been verified. All good. So, you know, the story is going. All right. Thank you, Mrs. I appreciate your time today. No problem. Thanks. Bye.
