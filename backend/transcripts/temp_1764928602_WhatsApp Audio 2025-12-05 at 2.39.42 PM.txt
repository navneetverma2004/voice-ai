 Hi, I'm trying to read your admin coordinator. This is the administrator. How can I help you? I had your name as well. I'm sorry about that. My name is The reason I was calling a little bit about our company, the way it works with us, is that our platform predicts patient demand and associated nurse workload and helping ensure staffing needs are met and balanced. So it matches your nurse skills and preferences given priority to staff nurses whenever possible. Depending on facility size, we're able to enhance your annual revenue by 5% to 8%, meaning around $250,000 to $850,000. Walter, I was reaching out to see if you would be able to speak with our staff just for a quick meet to see if this is something that will work for you guys. We have time maybe next week if that works for you. Will it be a call or a face to face? This is just a brief. But if you're not even do that, you can definitely take it from your phone. You don't have to be on camera or anything like that. Just want an opportunity to present what we have to show you. Okay. And how about next Tuesday? Next Tuesday. Don't have time next Tuesday. Does the end of this week work for you? I have Thursday, Friday. I have next Monday and next Thursday and Friday as well. Let's see. If I say next Monday, could you, like, tell me again, like on Monday, like we do Monday afternoon, could you like, send an email, Monday? Yes, for sure. So you said... Reminder. Okay, so you want to do the afternoon. Does maybe after lunch work, 1.30 or later than that? Let's say 1.30. 1.30 is good. Okay, gotcha. All right. And could you spell out your email address for me? Hold on, let me write that one. And will you send, like, something in the email? Right, yeah. I'm going to send out an invite for sure. And... Gotcha. And what was your title again? The Nursing Home Administrator. Gotcha. All right. And your read? Yes. Okay. This one to make sure. All right, ma'am. Do you want to be the best phone number to reach you? Yes. Okay. Do you have a direct extension? Nope. You just have to call and ask to speak with them. Okay, gotcha. All right. And do you know your current scheduling process? As in? Like, what are you guys doing internally for your scheduling? I don't. I think we're using either the matrix system or I'm not familiar at all how they do their scheduling. Okay, no worries. About how many nurses do you have on staff? Nurses. About five to seven. Okay. Do you guys use any agency nurses today? No. Okay. All right, no worries then. Just all the information I need. Again, you'll be meeting with...that is our director of operations and I'll make sure to put that note in there to give you a heads up on Monday morning. Sounds good. All right. So I'll have you down for Friday...I'm Friday, for Monday, February 3rd at 1.30 p.m. And we will talk to you then. Thank you so much for taking my call. No problem. You have a good day. You too. Take care. Thank you. Bye-bye.
