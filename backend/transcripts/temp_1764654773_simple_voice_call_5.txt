 You're for calling Amazon customer service. This is Georgina. How can I help? Hi Georgina. This is Brian. I'm calling because I haven't received my item yet. Hello Brian. I'm really sorry if you haven't received your parcel. No worries. Since you have me on the line, I'll be more than willing to assist. Oh, okay. All right. For security purposes, can I have the complete name on the account? Sure. It's Brian Johnson. Okay. Can I also have your email address? Sure. It's Brian 205 and yeah, how is that going? Thanks for verifying those information to me. Let me proceed to your account. It seems that you are referring to Meetup Tag 500 X5. Am I right? You got it right Georgina. Cool. Based on the information here, yeah, it already passed estimated... to meet a delivery date. It is quite late for a week already. Since the item is shipped and sold by Amazon, we can process a full refund or a replacement. Which one would rip for you? I really wanted to get the item as soon as possible. I choose the free shipping to save shipment fees. However, I didn't expect that it will come later than expected. I'm really sorry for the inconvenience, Brian. To compensate, I can request a refund for that order and process a replacement right now. Then, expect at it to one day shipping without additional cost for the shipping. Really? You can't do that from me? Yes, of course. Let me process your order. One moment please. Thanks. Please take your time. I know how in the world can I receive the refund. Brian 305 was already requested. Expect to receive the refund within two to three business days. It will be credited back to the original payment method you use in placing the order. Also, I've already processed the replacement. You can have the item by today until tomorrow. Then, the confirmation regarding our conversation will be sent to your account. If you want, I can also help you track your order and reach you back tomorrow just to make sure that you are receiving the item within the expected date. Yes, please. Great. Can I have your phone number? Sure. It's 314346. Got it. Thanks. Expect my call tomorrow. I will. Aside from this, is there anything else that I can help you back? No, you're doing great, great. I really appreciate it. Thank you, Brian. I think we are all set. For other queries, feel free to visit our health beaches. Thank you for calling Amazon and have a nice day. Thank you so much. Goodbye.
