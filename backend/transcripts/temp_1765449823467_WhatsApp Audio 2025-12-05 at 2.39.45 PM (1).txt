 Hello. Hi, please. And I was going to reach for... Speaking. Yes, ma'am. You provide a service that helps doctors and medical practices get paid more from open claims by fixing them fast and making things more transparent. Have you recently checked how your provider handles claims or have you considered it? Not right now. We are not in... Not right now, yes. Okay. What EHR system are you guys currently using? It doesn't matter. We are going to change it probably. Okay. Well, that's definitely the reason why I was reaching out. Our approach often works with what you're already doing, and we can actually increase your payment cycle by 10%. So the way it works, we will check all of your unpaid claims every month, fix any problems fast, and help with the paperwork to get you set up with insurance companies with your existing systems. So again, we will increase your payment cycle by 10%. And we don't give up, so we will file a pill to the state or federal level to get claims paid. And we also will provide you with monthly reports on all your activities and provider enrollment credentialing. So we can work with any existing system and offer advanced features for guiding services based on patient conditions. And the purpose of my call was to see if you would be open just to a quick meeting with our owner to see if this is something that will work for you. If you have some time, maybe this week's end or next week. I will tell you right now. It's probably not the time to look if you can contact me at the beginning of next year. Because we are going through some changes right now and it's just not the right time to make any decision, basically. Okay. And what are the most EHR you are working with? Well, that was why I wanted to connect you with our owner. We're definitely not trying to sell you anything right now. We just absolutely want to help you learn how we can help. If you have a good email address, I definitely can send you over some information. And what was your title? Are you the... I'm the practice manager. Practice manager. Okay. Yes. Gotcha. And is this the best phone number to reach you? This is my cell phone number, yes. Okay. All right. A lot. Of course. I mean, do you know about how many new patients that you add per month? I do not know, but probably at least 20, 30. 20 or 30? Okay. Yes. And I know that you were inquiring about pricing. Do you have time maybe next Tuesday for maybe 15 minutes? I would say Tuesdays are not good for me because usually I have at least two webinars. Okay, got it. Months, months are the best days for me. Monday. And you're on... Yes. Okay. How does Monday sound? Maybe 9.15 or 10.15? 9.15 is fine. Yes. 9.15. Gotcha. Okay. Yes. Again, just be a quick date with our owner. Be sure to ask any questions that you have about pricing. He knows way more than I do about the... Of course, he's an expert at this. We would love to go over that and just do a quick introduction, answer any questions that you have. So, I'll put you down for Monday, March 17th, 9.15. Okay. Yes, that's fine. Sure. All right. Well, thank you so much for your time and we'll definitely be in touch on Monday morning. Okay? Thank you. Bye-bye. Thank you so much. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
