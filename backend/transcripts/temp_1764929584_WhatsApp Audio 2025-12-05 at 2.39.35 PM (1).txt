 Hello, this is Jim. My name is Jim. I'm actually a field employee. I was trying to see, would you be the person that would be in charge of the field employee? Yes, sir. So, again, with, we actually attend the, annually, what we do is we provide a timekeeping automation software for the wireless construction industry to just help increase the time that your remote employees would spend at the job site. Were you able to attend the conference here this year? Yeah, I did. I actually was able to be out there this year, so I did actually go out there this year. Did you happen to see us while you were up there by chance? I don't know if I did because I was pulled in so many directions when I was out there. I hear you. I did have a chance to go through the floor a little bit, but it was definitely hard because I was getting pulled into meetings in that store. I still got field operations to run back home, so I had to break off for a while because work doesn't stop while we're gone. And fires don't stop either, which our field guys' collars don't stop either. Yep, yeah. It's a crazy industry to be in, and that's definitely the biggest thing to it. It is. So what we do is we actually help to reduce the non-productive time that employees would spend away from the job sites. We don't replace like your current systems as we really just focus on that time capture site. What it does is it automates it so that your crew is just simply clock in and clock out, and we take care of the rest. So it allocates the hours and everything for you guys using GPS tracking, you know, so the proper job codes and activity codes and things like that are used. So we don't replace like your payroll system. We actually integrate into it to just help payroll run quicker and just increase that time again that the employees would spend the job site by 10 and sometimes even up to 15%. The reason we're reaching out is really just to see if you'd be open to an email with some information and then just a quick call with our crew where you can actually show you what it looks like and how it would implement for you guys. I think I will be. If you can't send me some information on that and know that maybe we can set up a Teams meeting sometime next week because I'm going to be on the road for the next tomorrow. Okay. If that is something that we can do something next week, it doesn't take a hard to look because I'm always, we're always looking to something to improve because we do, we do every loss productivity on time is one of the biggest costs to the company. And there's no doubt that there's no doubt about that. Because trust me, I see it every day and it's I don't think you're ever eliminated, but to mitigate it to the best of our to the more we can help mitigate it the better it is overall, you know, and it's just it's just getting in. It's kind of helping out with lost, you know, because there's a lot of unproductive time and we have to pay for that. We can't take away that time. If they're on the clock, they're on the clock and we got to pay for it. But I know a lot of that's unproductive time. Right. Yeah, and that's that big piece, you know, that's that part that we kind of want to fill that gap in on is, you know, even if you can't fully manage it, you know, hey, let's manage it to the best and make sure that, you know, even the field employees know, hey, look, they know what's going on at all times as well. That's that piece we want to try to help eliminate for you guys. What's that best email for me to send that information over to you at it? Okay. Well, let me send that information over to you. I know you said you're going to be on the road tomorrow. I do have some availability Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, next week, right? I can even just put something there on the calendar for you. Yeah, let's go ahead and try to do like a Thursday because I will be Thursday is usually when I'm back in usually I have a most of my free time on my calendar. Okay. I've got as early as like an 11 and then I've even got like a two or two 30 is one of those a better time for you. That's about two o'clock. Two o'clock. Okay. And you correct. Correct. Okay. Well, let me throw that on here. And then again, I'll send that information over to you so you can get a chance to look at it before and then kind of go over everything for you. How many crews do you guys typically run out in the field? We usually run about five or six, but anywhere from anywhere from five to seven crews, depending sometimes we merge them together depending on how big the nature of the job is. But we average anywhere from five to six crews and they have about four or five people each on them. So that's about where we're at with that. Okay. All right. Well, I'll send that information over to you and then Thursday at two o'clock we'll reach out to you through that meeting. Okay. I'll send that link over to you here in just a second as well so you got it. But I appreciate your time, sir. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day. You too, sir. Thank you. Appreciate the call. Thank you. My pleasure. Bye.
