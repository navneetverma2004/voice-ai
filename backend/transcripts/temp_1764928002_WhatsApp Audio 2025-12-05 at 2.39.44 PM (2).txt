 Please stay on the line while your call is transferred to the operator. How can I help you? Hey, I was just hoping that I could speak to whoever would be in charge of facility operation. Hello. Hey, how's it going? My name is I'm with the post transfer over to reception. I was just hoping to reach the person that would be in charge of facility operation. That's me, what's up? Hey man, how's it going? Design and construction management for companies like yours? You guys considering any facility changes or renovations? No, not currently. Okay, yeah, no, completely understand. It's still an opportunity to kind of introduce ourselves and maybe establish a relationship for any future project or design needs that you might have. I'm just here to give out some information. I mean the way that it works is we basically handle everything from the design to the construction aspect. We're single point of contact so everything is clear communication efficient and make sure it's successful for you. A couple of accolades, we have an 85% repeat referral business with some major companies like the name of SEAL. So I really was just hoping to get that info across. Is it okay if maybe I send some information via your email just so you have something to read? I think I'm good for right now. I mean I could always reach out. I mean you can send me your contact information for sure but I mean if I need something I could certainly reach out to you. We could have a meeting and discuss if I have any future projects. Keep you in the mind. Oh yeah, no absolutely man. Listen I was just hoping to get your email sent some information and then we'd give you a call within the next couple of weeks to see how you're doing. If there's anything that we can help you for. Just don't bother me with a bunch of crap emails. No, no worries man. I literally get about 120 emails per day. I hear you. I totally understand. I'll give you my email address so I'm going to start with. Just don't bombard me with. Perfect. What was your first name? Where are you guys located at? Sorry my line is breaking up. What were you saying? Where are you located at? I'm actually calling out of but we're based out in Crescent. So I'm going to get that information sent over to you. I'll give you a quick call in the next week to kind of discuss anything that you might have. Any questions? Do you know of any design needs that your company might have now or in the future? No, not yet. This company has expanded over the past 65 years multiple times with big renovations and big expansions. We have a 54,000 square foot manufacturing facility so it has grown in size and shape many times over the years. I think they actually have the main guys that do our building so if there was a shot at that it would probably be our guys that have done it in the past to be honest with you. They come with these big structural bug girders and beams and beams and stuff and another 100 feet by 100 feet long. There's been big projects here previously. Are you experiencing growth plans or growth or plans to consolidate facilities? No, nothing like that. I totally get it. Alright, well that's great. I'll have that information sent over to you. Like I said, I'll give you a call to see how you're doing with the information. Really quickly, you're the facility manager, right? I just missed that one. Alright, Pat, well it was a pleasure speaking with you. We look forward to talking soon.
