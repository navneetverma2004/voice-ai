This is calling with... Well, I'm calling on behalf of the employee health insurance plan. Yes, I am. Yeah, we were calling to give some information because we do have a program that's exclusively available to contractors and can reduce the premiums to up to 30%. Have you guys kind of already looked into reviewing your current plan? We did, and we actually just renewed March 1. Okay, March 1. You guys just renewed? Yeah. Right? Well, usually with most insurance plans, you guys aren't actually locked into a contract. So we're just kind of trying to send some information because most brokers don't have access to the program that we offer. We just kind of want to compare it to what you currently are doing right now to see if you could do a little bit better pricing. Okay, so what do you need from me? Yeah, we would like to at least send an email to you just to review. Okay, yeah. You want to send me an email? I don't. Oh, completely off. I know. Nobody ever gets there right. I think I'm the only person that spells it like that ever. Too many different variations for that name. There aren't, yeah. So I'll send you that information. Basically, the way we do is we do look at your current plan and just kind of go back and forth with what your specific needs are and then design a long-term healthcare program. Just kind of give your guys' business a little more control. So I'll send that information out to you. Do you guys have any challenges you face with your current health plan or any improvements? Not that I know of. Okay, so you guys are pretty happy right now. Yeah, all right. Well, yeah, I'll get that information sent out to you after we give you some time to look over it. Are you available for just a quick phone call with our broker? Yeah, sometime next week. So anytime before two o'clock usually works. And then is Monday a good day for you or? It's usually not. Usually like Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday is better. Okay. I can do a Tuesday and you said before two o'clock. It's fine. Yep. All right. I can have him call you at 11 a.m. if that works for you. That's perfect. Okay, perfect. Well, I'll have him reach out to you then. And then just a few more questions. How many full-time employees do you guys currently have? We have eight of us. And then you do currently offer insurance so you know who your courier is? Yeah. And then do you offer vision, dental, life insurance as well? Dental and vision. All right. And then do you guys offer a 401K plan as well? Yes, we do. Good. And then the last question is do you know how much your company contributes to employee premiums? Yeah, so we do 90%. All right. Perfect. Well, I'll get this over to the one calling you and he can just kind of toss up a plan and kind of compare it to what you have going on now. But I'll send you a little information about our company and then if you'll call next Tuesday, so that's going to be the 15th. So he'll call you on the 15th at 11 a.m. Perfect. Sounds good. All right. Perfect. Well, you have a good one, Miss Kay. All right. Thanks, you do. Thanks for your help. Bye-bye. Bye.
