 Thank you. My name is I'm not a problem. I've got some I have some time next Friday. Next Friday the 23rd. Oh, that is the 23rd, not the 16th. My bad. Hold on. Yes, next Friday the 23rd. Already? And this might sound silly, but you are in. Right. Yes, ma'am. Okay. I can't tell you how many times I've thought I was calling one place and turns out I was calling another. So I like to double check. I have. Are you in? I am. Okay. My managed service provider is now. How ironic. So for the 23rd, I've got pretty much all day open. Do you prefer mornings, afternoons? Let's do the morning. Let's say 1030. I do have a 1030 open is your email. So. Fantastic. What I will go ahead and do then is get you an email sent out with a link to join that quick zoom with. And he will be giving you that call on Friday, May 23rd at 1030 Pacific time. Okay. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you. Have a good day. You too. Take care.
