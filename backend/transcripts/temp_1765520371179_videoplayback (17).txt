 Thank you. My name is Carol Neverland. Berl ° Mrs. Ą I tell you how many times I've thought I was calling one place and turns out I was calling another so I like to double check. I have... Are you in? Yes, I am. Okay. I'm going to put my managed service provider. How ironic. So, for the 23rd, I've got pretty much all day open. Do you prefer mornings, afternoons? Let's do the morning. Let's say 10.30? I do have a 10.30 open. Is your email still open? Yes. Fantastic. What I will go ahead and do then is get you an email sent out with a link to join that quick Zoom with...and he will be giving you that call on Friday, May 23rd at 10.30 Pacific Time. Okay. Sound good. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you. Have a good day. You too. Take care.
