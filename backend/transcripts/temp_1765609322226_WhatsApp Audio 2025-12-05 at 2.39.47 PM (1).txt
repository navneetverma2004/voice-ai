So I'm with a company called Z. So we're to insurance the agency as well and we have a workers comp platform that can offer coverages for the new required policies on how to deal with the SB 216 state regulations on workers comp. So the SB 216 state regulations that mandate certain contractors to carry workers compensation insurance even if they don't have employees. So like I said, we're an insurance agency offering workers comp underwriting and ghost policies so we can help you save time with no duplicate entries and it's one application where we can compare quotes and then our platform also provides instant ghost policy quote forms for free with no midterm audits and we also do traditional workers compensation as well.
