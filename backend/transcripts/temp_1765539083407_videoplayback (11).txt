What we do is like all the students are... There's no limit to how many players can play. You can reuse the event whenever you want to. It's just downloading an app and can play this team-based escape adventure right on campus. It takes very little time to plan about less than 30 minutes of your time to set up. We can customize it to any event that you're planning. So it coincides with like semesters, what have you. We've done like Halloween, scavenger hunt, spring day, welcome week events.
