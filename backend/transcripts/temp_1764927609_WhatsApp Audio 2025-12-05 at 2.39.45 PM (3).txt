 Good morning, of the company's life. Hi, good morning. Good morning. My name is Paul. I'm with the company called, so we're the ones, you know, we do these custom outdoor, indoor, digital escape adventures with colleges. All right. Did you recall meeting with us before? Did you jump on a call with us or see a demo? Does that sound familiar? Maybe. Yeah, I know. I'm sure, you know, I'm sure you meet with a lot of people. Yeah, so just a quick refresher. So it's a custom outdoor, indoor, digital escape adventures we do with colleges. Okay. So all students or staff do is download our app and you can play this team-based escape adventure right on campus. Now, I think I recall that, yeah. I think I mentioned that that might be ideal for our orientation. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I recall that, yes. Oh, you do recall that. Okay, yeah, because it does work well in the orientation space because we, you know, it doesn't take a lot of time to plan and we can customize the program or event so it coincides with your semester so we don't like custom Halloween, you know, scavenger hunts, you know, welcome weeks, you know, spring days, fall festivals. We can really customize the program to any kind of event. Are you part of the orientation programming? Yes, we are. Yeah. Oh, you are? Okay. And yeah, because I don't know what the time, was it like timing, budget? Do you remember what was? It was timing. So, I mean, right now it's a good time to consider it because, I mean, we don't have the budget just yet but the budget will be allocated somewhere in July. Okay. It's a good time to actually think about what we are planning, you know, for a year. Yeah, because that's, this is what, this is, because we understand the process as colleges go so this is why we contact colleges now so they think of us for some fall programming, you know, you know, because we know, you know, we know you have to plan ahead. And of course, when is, is the orientation, is the orientation, is it like, is it like Labor Day, August, October, when is that? It's in August. It's late, they have a calendar with me but 20 seconds of August around it. Okay. Yeah, so, yeah, because we just wanted to, yeah, so that's why we're reaching out. Just to see if you still be open to considering the great game for, you know, for orientation. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we definitely, I'll definitely consider it. Thanks for the call so I have that in mind. Do you mind sending me an email with more info? Okay. I do want to pitch this to the rest of the team. Okay. We need to start allocating funding for the different things that we want to pay for, for orientation. Yeah, you want to start, yeah, you're starting. Yeah, perfect. So, well, this is what we did because you might have, did you see the demo before? Do you remember? I believe so, yes. Okay. I think I remember that, yes. You probably met with our CEO, my colleague. Yeah, yeah, so the best thing to do at this stage, you know, because we want to, you know, we want to go over the info, like you said, and just kind of brainstorm some ideas for orientation, and, you know, of course, talk about cost and things like that. Right. So you're going to be talking budget in July? Yes, yes, because we need to, I mean, we're actually going to start planning our orientation next month in April. Okay. Just around the corner. So you're going to be, so you're going to be start talking about planning orientation next month in April? Okay. Yes, I do. So why don't we do this? Because the best thing to do is, why don't we, do you have some time, because the best would be if we do a quick, if you could do a quick phone call with that. Okay. And then you can kind of, you know, just go over, you know, what we went over last year and just kind of get you ready when you guys start talking about that in April. Would you have some time for a quick phone call, like here at the end of March? Or be a day? Ideally, ideally I would like to schedule a call with my supervisor. Okay. I'll have to ask her. That's the only issue because I know she's really busy. Because meeting with me wouldn't have, you know, much impact. I think the product is good. But I really want to show that to the rest of the team. Okay. See, you know, where our, you know, budget wise, where we are and so how we can incorporate that into the whole programming. Well, this is what you could do because it's been a while since we talked. Why don't you just do like a, could it be good to have all the information together when you do talk to your colleague? So it would be definitely worth your while just to, you don't have to see the demo, but just do like a quick 15 minute call with Alex. And then you can kind of, you know, get all your ducks in line with the information about cost and things like that. So then, yeah, it won't take a lot of your time. And then after you talk to him, you guys, you guys could set up like a, like a demo with your director. And then, you know, that would be the best move. Could he talk to you? I was thinking on Friday. Okay. So I think the best date to meet, so I have also some solid dates on when we would, okay. I have a meeting on the first, April 1st. So any date afterwards. So April 2nd, April 3rd, Wednesday, Thursday. Yeah, Wednesday. How's Wednesday the second? Wednesday is the second. Okay. That would work. What is, is this time good? 1145? Actually, yeah, that would work. That works? Okay. Okay. And then, and what was your email again, because we're going to send you a. Okay. And then, okay. All right. Perfect. So we. Very good. All right. We look forward to talking to you then. Have a great rest of your week. You too. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
