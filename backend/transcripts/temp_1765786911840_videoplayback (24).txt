 Hey, how's it going? I was hoping that I could speak to you. How are you? My name is, your agency is active with us. We're just following up to get you set up with it. You're aware that we've added online. Oh, I didn't, you know what? Thank you for calling. Yeah, I did see that I was, I didn't get an email that I was active, but I did randomly just log in, well go to the site and I'm active. Do you have an appetite guide that I can take a look at so I can make sure that, yeah, so I'm trying to write some for business with you guys? Yeah, no, absolutely. Well, that's kind of why we wanted to get connected, make sure that we have all the information across to you, especially the information that you're requesting. Can we, can I get your email so I can send over some information to you? Absolutely. Okay, awesome. Yeah, what was your name? My email is my first name. Yeah, so I'm not sure if you got connected with him before, but he's just looking to meet with you for 30 minutes sometime within the next week or so. He works with our broker partners just to kind of learn more about how the platform works for you. Can we get that set up? So I want to, I know you're over in, so if he, okay, can we do next like 12 o'clock? I'm sorry, what day would they say? That would be next Tuesday the first at 12 central. Yeah, sure, absolutely. Okay, awesome. So I'm going to put that up. And then is there anybody else that you want to include in the call or just yourself? Yes, myself. Okay. Do you offer instant quotes on your website? I'm actually building out the website. Okay. So basically I'll have that option. That's going to be the third quarter of the year. I'll have the website up and running. Okay. And are you interested in receiving traditional policy information as well? I know you had some questions there, but it's just a question that I put in from- I'm sure. That's fine. All right. So I just want to confirm that I have all the details. So yeah, like I said, we do, it's a direct to consumers quote form that we've developed, so it's no code at no cost to you. So that could be a cool little feature and we do offer all kinds. But I'm going to get you booked in. I have your email. I have everything that I need. It's going to be next Tuesday the first at 12 central with Jeff. All right. Sound good. Take care. Take care. Bye.
