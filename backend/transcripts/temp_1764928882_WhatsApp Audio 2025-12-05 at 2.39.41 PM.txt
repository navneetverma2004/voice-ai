 Hello. Hi, Isis. Yeah, hi. Hi. How are you doing today? Good, how are you? I'm doing good. We just wanted to call you to thank you for giving us a bit of your time to learn more about your solar power for your home. I felt that one of our professionals put together a proposal for you. We were just kind of hoping to gain some feedback on our process and get you reconnected with our team to fill in the gaps. Is there any chance you have some time to revisit the proposal and discuss the next steps or? We can do it later, yeah. Okay, awesome, yeah. So it's just mainly so I could book you in for a phone call for an estimate there. And obviously to meet with another pro, see if the new program kind of fits all your needs. If we did that, there's a pretty open calendar here. I have, would Friday work for you? I have a ton of time in there. No, not this week. Wednesday? No, next week Thursday. Next week Thursday? Okay, maybe like 10 a.m.? No, later after 1 p.m. Okay, I have a one o'clock slot open for next Thursday the 27th. That's okay. Okay. Okay, so I have your email as... Yeah. Okay, perfect. So I'm going to put that in for you. But before I let you go, I just had a quick question. So to confirm, right, you're good for next Thursday, 1 p.m. Eastern Standard. Is there anyone else from your household that's going to be joining us on the call or...? No, I'm done. Okay, perfect. All right, so I just want to make sure I got you booked in for that. So again, right, like I said, we're just giving you another review with one of our Solar Pros just to review the new program to give you a much better ROI and your solar project. So it'll definitely be worth your time there. But yeah, I appreciate your time. You're going to get that 15-minute call next Thursday, 1 o'clock, all right? Okay, thank you.
