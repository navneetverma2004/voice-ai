 Thank you for calling Matrabuse. This is a shalein. How can I help you today? You tell me. I'm looking at my statement. It is either you guys charge my credit card for $6 to $7.81 when I initially signed up for a $40 plan. Guess what? My bank charged me for an overdraft fee. This is ridiculous. If I know that you lied to me, I should have chosen global phone instead. Very, very disappointing. I've been with you guys for so many years now. I've started my account in Postpaid and decided to switch over Pre-Pay. And I want you to cancel my account completely. I don't want to deal with this again. Oh, I'm so sorry about this. I can't blame you if you'll feel that way. It's really surprising that you've been charged $6 to $7.81 instead of just $40. It's a huge amount of money. And I want to make sure that this will be taking care of today. By the way, let me have your name so I can address you properly. My name is Linda Morone. And you better do something about this today or I'll change carriers. I understand Linda. And it won't let you go unless and until this is resolved. And I want to make sure that I'll be able to track all the details of your account so I could come up with the best resolution for you today. May have your mobile number and your four digit pin please. Mobile number is 607-598-6992. Pin is 0903. Thank you. All right, so Linda was able to pull up your account details. I've seen that he initially created the account through our Metribuse Store last December 21st. And the plan that was created for you was the $65 unlimited plan. So it includes unlimited calls, text and data. The additional $2.81 that was charged is coming from the taxes. Wait, so the $65 plan is unlimited? What about the $40? I thought $40 is unlimited. That's what his hails person told me last time. Oh, I apologize for the confusion. The $40 plan has unlimited calls and checks, but the data is not unlimited. You'll only get five gigs of data for $40. Of Linda, we have four different plans. We have a $30 plan that's cheap as that we have. It has unlimited calls and checks, but it doesn't have a data on it. Then the $40 plan that has unlimited calls and checks with five gigs of data, a $50 plan with unlimited calls and checks and 15 gigabytes of data. And lastly, the $65 plan with unlimited calls, checks and data. So let me make sure that I understand it correctly. The sales person told you that the $40 plan has unlimited calls, texts and data is that correct. Well, actually to be honest with you, I'm not sure. He's telling me bunch of different things. And he don't remember if the $40 plan includes unlimited data, but I'm pretty sure it has unlimited calls and texts. Okay, that's all right. If I may ask, how do you usually use your phone in terms of data? In terms of data? Well, I use Facebook a lot, I watch Netflix a lot, check my email and play some games too. Well, that's quite a lot. So do you think that the $50 plan for $40 would be enough for you? No, I don't think it would work. I'll stay with the current plan I have. Right. This plan is really perfect for you since you've got so many activities that requires data. And with this $65 limited plan, you won't need to worry about running out of data. Got it. So to confirm, you'd like to stay with your $65 limited plan. So I'll keep it as it is for you. No changes should be made correct. That's right. All righty. So do you have any other questions for me today? No, Jolene. So I'll pay $65 per month for the unlimited plan in $2.81 for the text is correct. Yes, that's correct Linda. Expect no other charges in your account every month aside from the $6 to $7.81. And by the way, I have a goodness for you. I understand that you've been with us for so many years now. You started your account with post paid and switch over pre paid. So the goodness about it is once you've reached your third month, so it does your next bill will have a $5 discount on it. So instead of paying $65 for the plan, it'll only be $60. And once you've reached your ninth month with pre paid, you'll get an additional $5 discount. So instead of paying $60, you'll only need to pay $55. Wow. That's awesome. This is a lot cheaper than what I've paid before in post pay. Exactly. Also, I've seen that your credit card is currently not enrolled in Odeopay. I'm glad to let you know that if you decided to enroll your credit card in Odeopay, you'll get an additional $5 discount on your bill every month. So let's say you decided to enroll your credit card in Odeopay today, you'll automatically get the $5 discount on your next billing cycle. So instead of paying $6.7.81, you'll only need to pay $62.81. Oh, seriously? How? Alright. Do you have the MetraBoost app on your phone? Yes, I do. I downloaded it last time. Awesome. Kindly tap that app for me. Log in with your MetraBoost account and let me know once you're in the homepage. Okay. I'm in. Alright. So on the upper left corner, you'll see the hamburger icon or the three horizontal lines, correct? Yes, I see it. Okay. Tap that for me. Alright. Now I see Feed Data Checker, Payment, Account, My Devices, Shop Now and Sign Out. Perfect. Now click on Payment. Okay. Now it says your next payment is due in 27 days. Available Balance is zero then below it says Add Funds. And the below add funds, have you seen the option to turn on the Odeopay? Oh, yeah, I do. Alright. So if you're ready to set up your Odeopay today, you'll just need to turn on the Odeopay option, key in your credit card information and save it. Okay, okay. I'll add a later because I'm not at home right now and I'll be using a different card for the Odeopay. Okay. No problem. You already noticed that so it'll be easy for you. Exactly. Well, thank you so much for letting me know all this good stuff. You're welcome Linda. And I appreciate your partner and me today to make sure that everything is clear in terms of your planned details. And I'm glad that I was able to give you a walkthrough on how to set up Odeopay so you can take advantage of this count that comes with it. So, would there be anything else that I could further assist you with today? No, honey. You've been very helpful. You bring back the confidence that they have with Metribus that I thought I lost when it started getting those unexplainable charges. But you've made everything so clear for me and now we understand how the plan works and they don't have any further questions. Oh, you just don't know how happy I am, Linda. Thank you for giving me the chance to bring back your trust with us. And if you don't have any further questions, thank you so much for being the best part of Metribus. Have a good one. Bye! You too, dear. Bye.
