 Hello? Hi. Hey, I'm with a company called... Yes. Yes. Okay. We're based here in the Baylor. We cover everything from major renovations to minor fixes. Okay. And we're always quick to respond, and we work together from design to execution. And so we worked with hundreds of clients here in... retail, hospitality, restaurant, medical. And so I was calling to see if you'd be open to an introduction with our CEO to see if our general contracting could be of help. I mean, I don't have anything right now. If you'd like to shoot me an email just to have you in file, you guys are building the new restaurant right now, the Spanish restaurant? The Spanish restaurant? Yeah, I see you got a truck out there. Oh, do you see our truck there? Yeah. Like I said, we work with hundreds of clients here in the state. Okay. Do you have a general contracting partner now? I do use somebody to do most of my work, but I don't have anything right now in the pipeline for any more restaurants or anything like that. Okay, so basically you're all built out. How many locations do you have? Four. You have four locations, but everything's built out. Yeah, everything's built out right now. Right now? Yeah. Because what we do is we have like a 24-7 facility maintenance department to ensure quick repairs with minimal disruption to operations. Okay. So we do like TI work and maintenance work. So even if you're not having any big built out construction projects, we're a good resource when you just need quick repairs with minimal disruption operations. Okay, so you shoot me an email? Okay, write your email. It's all right. I'm just going to go back to the chat. Yeah, so... Yeah, so... Yeah, I mean, would you have... The Google Meets, it's only 15 minutes. I mean, it's not a bad idea just to kind of, you know... Yeah, maybe, yeah, I'll look at it after I get an email and stuff. That'd be good. Okay, yeah, so why have we on the phone? Can I just put it on the calendar for like early next week? I'm in the... We're at lunch right now. Oh, you're at lunch right now? Yeah, yeah. How about this? Can I send you an email and just give you a call back next week? Sounds great. That sounds great. We'll connect that way then. Okay, thank you. Have a great rest of your afternoon. You too. Bye.
