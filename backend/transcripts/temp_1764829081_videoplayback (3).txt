 Thank you for calling Matribuse. This is a Shalene. How can I help you today? You tell me. I'm looking at my statement and see that you guys charged my credit card for $67.81 when I initially signed up for a $40 plan. Guess what? My bank charged me for an overdraft fee. This is ridiculous. If I know that you lied to me, I should have chosen Global Phone instead. Very, very disappointing. I've been with you guys for so many years now. I've started my account in postpaid and decided to switch over prepay and I want you to cancel my account completely. I don't want to deal with this again. Oh, I'm so sorry about this. I can't blame you if you'll feel that way. It's really surprising that you've been charged $67.81 instead of just $40. It's a huge amount of money. And I want to make sure that this will be taken care of today. By the way, let me have your name so I can address you properly. My name is Linda Marrone and you better do something about this today or I'll change carriers. I understand Linda and it won't let you go unless and until this is resolved. And I want to make sure that I'll be able to track all the details of your account so I could come up with the best resolution for you today. May have your mobile number in your four digit pin please. Mobile number is 607-598-6992. Pin is 0903. Thank you. Alright, so Linda was able to pull up your account details. I've seen that you initially created the account through our Metribus store last December 21st and the plan that was graded for you was the $65 unlimited plan. So it includes unlimited calls, texts and data. The additional $2.81 that was charged is coming from the taxes. Wait, so this $65 plan is unlimited? What about the $40? I thought $40 is unlimited. That's what the salesperson told me last time. Oh, I apologize for the confusion. The $40 plan has unlimited calls and texts but the data is not unlimited. You'll only get 5 gigs of data for $40. Linda, we have four different plans. We have a $30 plan, the cheapest that we have. It has unlimited calls and texts but it doesn't have a data on it. Then the $40 plan that has unlimited calls and texts with 5 gigs of data, a $50 plan with unlimited calls and texts and 15 gigabytes of data. And lastly, the $65 plan with unlimited calls, texts and data. So let me make sure that I understand it correctly. The salesperson told you that the $40 plan has unlimited calls, texts and data. Is that correct? Well, actually to be honest with you, I'm not sure. He's telling me bunch of different things and he don't remember the $40 plan includes unlimited data but I'm pretty sure it has unlimited calls and texts. Okay, that's all right. If I may ask, how do you usually use your phone in terms of data? In terms of data, well, I use Facebook a lot. I watch Netflix a lot, check my email and play some games too. Wow, that's quite a lot. So do you think that the 5 gigs of data for $40 would be enough for you? No, I don't think it would work. I'll stay with the current plan I have. Right. This plan is really perfect for you since you've got so many activities that requires data. And with this $65 and limited plan, you won't need to worry about running out of data. Got it. So to confirm, you'd like to stay with your $65 plan. So I'll keep it as it is for you. No changes should be made, correct? That's right. Alrighty. So, well, do you have any other questions for me today? No, Jolene. So, well, I'll pay $65 per month for the unlimited plan and $2.81 for the taxes, correct? Yes, that's correct Linda. Expect no other charges in your account every month aside from the $67.81. And by the way, I have a goodness for you. I understand that you've been with us for so many years now. You started your account with postpaid and switch over prepaid. So the goodness about it is once you've reached your third month with us, your next bill will have a $5 discount on it. So instead of paying $65 for the plan, it only be $60. And once you've reached your ninth month with prepaid, you'll get an additional $5 discount. So instead of paying $60, you'll only need to pay $55. Wow, that's awesome. This is a lot cheaper than what I've paid before in postpay. Exactly. Also, I've seen that your credit card is currently not enrolled in auto pay. I'm glad to let you know that if you decided to enroll your credit card in auto pay, you'll get an additional $5 discount on your bill every month. So let's say you decided to enroll your credit card in auto pay today, you'll automatically get the $5 discount on your next billing cycle. So instead of paying $67.81, you'll only need to pay $62.81. Oh, seriously? How? All right, do you have the Metribus app on your phone? Yes, I do. I downloaded it last time. Awesome. Kylie, tap that app for me. Log in with your Metribus account and let me know once you're on the homepage. Okay? Okay, I'm in. All right. So on the upper left corner, you'll see the hamburger icon or the three horizontal lines, correct? Yes, I see it. Okay. Tap that for me. All right. Now I see feed data checker payment account, my devices, shop now and sign out. Perfect. Now click on payment. Okay. Now it says your next payment is due in 27 days. Available balance is zero. Then below it says add funds. Okay. And below add funds, have you seen the option to turn on the auto pay? Oh, yeah, I do. All right. So if you're ready to set up your auto pay today, you'll just need to turn on the auto pay option, key in your credit card information and save it. Okay. Okay. I'll add it later because I'm not at home right now and I'll be using a different card for the auto pay. Okay. No problem. You already noticed that so it'll be easy for you. Exactly. Well, thank you so much for letting me know all this good stuff. You're welcome, Linda. And I appreciate your partnering with me today to make sure that everything is clear in terms of your plan details. And I'm glad that I was able to give you a walkthrough on how to set up auto pay so you can take advantage of this account that comes with it. So, well, would there be anything else that I could further assist you with today? No, honey, you've been very helpful. You bring back the confidence that I have with Metribuse that I thought I lost when I started getting those unexplainable charges. But give me everything so clear for me and now we understand how the plan works and I don't have any further questions. Oh, you just don't know how happy I am, Linda. Thank you for giving me the chance to bring back your trust with us. And if you don't have any further questions, thank you so much for being the best part of Metribuse. Have a good one. Bye. You too, dear. Bye.
