 Hello? Hello. This is the office. May I speak to the person that would be in charge of your workers' comp insurance? What are you speaking to him? Well, hi. Like I said, I'm with the office and we actually have a workers' comp takeout program that offers standard proposals that are typically about 20% cheaper than your state plan. I was just calling to see if you would be open to receiving a free insurance proposal by email and just a quick call in about a week or so with our owner-marshal questions. Is it a PPO or anything? This is for workers' comp. What do they call the payroll work-mix comp? Is that what it is? Yes. Yes. I think I've gone through this before. That thing is called. And originally the original quote was like $165 a week to do the payroll regardless if there's any payroll. You just have to pay that fee and then it jumped up to like $300 or something a week. For their workers' comp insurance? No, just for the payroll. This is just for workers' comp insurance. Oh, so it's not the payroll? No, no, no, no. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I answered you wrong. This is just for workers' comp insurance. Yes. Right now I have the AUA. The AUA. And I know it is very difficult. I've heard that over and over and over again. But we could save you up to 20% compared to the state rates. But the way it works is even as an out of state contractor you still need of course your workers' comp. And what we do is we connect you with private carriers offering better rates and flexible payment plans instead of that high upfront state premium. And Mark has managed over 80,000 policies nationwide. And so we just wanted to see if maybe we could just give you a free quote. He'll just come by email and then he'll call in about a week or so just to see if you have any questions. It can't hurt and it could save you some money. Yeah. I'm interested in getting a quote. Would this be insurance for basically all states or just Florida? Just Florida. It is. Now I can put on there that you are interested for other states and see if he can help you out with that as well. But what I'm calling for is that I can make a note of that. Have you had any workers' comp losses? No. No losses. Okay. Well that's always good. So no losses. All I need to do is just get just a little bit of information. I just need your first and last name. That's a win. Is that with a V or a pH? With a V. With a V. Okay. I always ask because you never know. And are you the owner of the company? Yes. Okay. Great. So I have a good number to reach. Yes. Okay. All right. Good number. And then an email address. It's. And you said you were interested in other states as well. Well what happened this year is I actually got a project in Ohio. It's another tough state that they required you to get their state insurance. Okay. So anyway, I ended up dissubbing that part of it out. I just subbed it out to another company. Okay. Well I'll let him know. But I could have put that on if I could have provided that work was comp for my guys. Right. Right. I understand. And I'll tell him that you're interested for other states. But you know, I know that. The door in my works. Yeah. Okay. Majorities and I know it's going to be very difficult and their rates are very, very high. And everybody that I've talked to has said that. So is about a week from now, would that be okay for him to give you a call? Yeah, that'll work. Okay. Is there a better day or that's better for you like a slower day during the week or they all real busy? They're all pretty good. Maybe a Thursday or Friday kind of thing. Thursday and Friday. Okay. So I'll put that down Thursday or Friday. And do you want afternoon or morning? What would be better? Good afternoon would be better. Afternoon. Are you central or eastern time? I'm central. You're central. Okay. All right. So you're in. Okay. So central time in the afternoon of Thursday or Friday. I have. And what we'll do is we'll get that quote together. I'll let him know that you know you're primarily in Florida, but you are interested in other states and then that's his name. He'll be giving you a call to kind of go over everything and answer any questions. Okay. Sam, I appreciate it. All right. Well, thank you. Appreciate you talking to me. Yep. Thank you. Thank you. Have a good day. All right. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
